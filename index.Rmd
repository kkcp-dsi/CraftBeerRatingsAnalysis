# Introduction

we can define **craft beer** as a beer made by a brewer that is small,
independent, and traditional. According to the [Brewers
Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/craft-brewer-definition/)
(BA), an industry group of mostly small, independent brewers, there are
more than 8,000 craft breweries in the U.S. Nearly 4,000 of them opened
between
[2015--2020](https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/).

At first We didn't have a good opinion on Beers, We used to think Beers
is much bitter compared to other available alcoholic beverages. Given we
did not get to try different Beers from Craft brewers as they are not
easily available when compared to Mass produced beers. With gradual
incline in craft beer community craft brewers started organizing Beer
Festivals and started making craft beers available in multiple
locations, that's when got to try different styles of beers and it
changed our perception altogether. we began to try more craft beers and
see that those around us were drinking them too.

As the community started to grow and we were trying different kinda of
beers bunch of mobile applications were released which will let you
check in a beer you are having and lets you give you rating for that
beer. This kind of helped the community to grow and also help fellow
craft beer enthusiast to find new styles of beers from different
breweries and identify new breweries.

As we both are Craft Beer Enthusiasts, we decided to analyze ratings
that were given out to the beers from all the independent breweries in
the country because we've always suspected the ratings in different
regions of the country may not follow the same pattern.

## To formulate our questions below,

1.  Find out if there is any correlation between the location of the
    brewery and the ratings that a brewery is getting
2.  Find out the correlation between beer styles and the kind of ratings
    they receive.
3.  As a bonus question, it would be nice to find out the highly rated
    styles of beers in each state because it would guide us in hunting
    the best beers in the future.
