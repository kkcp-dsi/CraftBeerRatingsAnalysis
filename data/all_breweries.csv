Amy smiled as she remembered Paul’s previous attempts at opening several breweries that never got off the notebook. Suffice it to say that several beers and several plates of Thanksgiving Dinner later a dream was born.

Co-founders John Tucci and Drew Barrington pooled their resources that year in order to commandeer a 25-barrel brewing system from a defunct brewery in San Francisco. They had known each other for more than a decade as fellow musicians and felt the craft beer business was where they belonged together. With John’s long history as a professional brewer, and Drew’s wide-ranging knowledge of the construction industry, it was a match made in beer nirvana.
An enormous warehouse in South San Francisco proved the ideal location to open up their brewery, a place to make massive amounts of beer – and for people to sample that beer in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.
As the only large-scale production brewery and tap room in South San Francisco, 47 Hills stands poised to carve out a new space for beer drinking and beer culture south of the City. The tap room and grill is a friendly place to meet, and the beer made on-site features one-of-a-kind recipes from master brewer John Tucci.

With a passion for home brewing and utilizing the finest ingredients in the industry, Founder David Olsen decided to brew up a business with Craft Artisan Ales - a small batch brewery with a focus on inventive styles and most importantly IPA's.
About three years ago he delved into home brewing as a long time connoisseur, first level Sommelier, and Certified Beer server. As with many things in his life, he took his passion for brewing to the extreme. After reading over 15 books on home brewing and attending classes at UC Davis Extension he experimented with a myriad of hop and grain combinations to create a flagship IPA…this today is the Ricketts Lab IPA, and the Nebulous Imperial IPA.
With the same pursuit of perfection, he has developed recipes for a number of other signature brews that will become available over the course of the next year. Until then, Craft Your Own Experience!

He decided to go to an auction, bid on a brew system, won said system, and took out a loan on the family home.
Lyne, was a little surprised when she awoke one morning to find a semi in the yard, full of brewing equipment, and Bill's declaration that not only were they opening a Restaurant / Brewery, but that they also just a little deeper in debt after the freshly paid off house was not so much anymore.
​Bill trained at the (now defunct) Sioux Falls Brewing Company, before opening up the doors in Watertown in August 1999.

Brew-on-premises, or “BOP,” allows customers to brew beer on professional brewing equipment regardless of prior brewing experience. Diving Dog provides the recipe, equipment, ingredients, and instruction for you to craft your beer.
Diving Dog also features thirty taps, two of which are nitrogen providing for smaller bubbles and a smoother mouthfeel (ideal for Stouts and Porters). Beyond the taps are a multitude of bottled beers, local wines, and nonalcoholic options. While there is no kitchen at the Diving Dog, outside food is always welcome from local eateries and we have already started partnering with local chefs for popups and beer pairings.
And about the name — having grown up with dogs that couldn’t stay out of the water, the Brewhouse is named in tribute to every amazing dog out there who will swim underwater to retrieve. A chocolate lab named Roscoe was the original diving dog.

Soon it was the social media joke amongst our friends to check in at ""Dutch's Tiki Bar"" on Instagram and Facebook. For years other friends always came to me and said, ""it always looks like your are having a good time at Dutch’s where is it?' When I would say that it was a bar in my backyard they seemed a little deflated that it wasn't a local stomping ground open to everyone. This reaction got me thinking- How can I bring that fun backyard bar feel to the masses?
A year or so went by and it hit me while trying to find a good place to get a craft beer with my brother in Bixby Knolls. I wanted to find a place that would be cool to hang out at that wasn't a big restaurant chain. This started me thinking that I should just open up a brewpub- the kind I would hang out at.

On any given day, the outdoor enthusiast enjoys activities ranging from the excitement of whitewater rafting, kayaking, downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, horseback riding, attending rodeos, windsurfing, water-skiing, mountain biking and climbing. If a more relaxing day is preferred, people can enjoy fishing, hiking, camping, sailing, antiquing, and bird watching or simply kicking back and taking in the spectacular views of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Located at 13415 Sierra Highway, Kern River Brewing Company is in the heart of all these activities. Show Less",Kern_River_Brewing_Co

The core of Lagunitas came from Chicago, St Louis, Memphis, Walker Creek, and the highlands of Quincy.
The Chicago contingent initiated the brewing and the gravitational effect of its suchness did the rest. We all loved the beer but the mission was larger than the ordinary joy of a hoppy-sweet quaff. It was driven unseen by an urge to communicate with people, to find our diasporidic tribe, and to connect with other souls adrift on a culture that had lost its center and spun its inhabitants to the four winds to wander lost and bereft with a longing to re-enter the light. Beer, we have learned, has always been a good lubricant for social intercourse!
The Lagunitas Brewing Co. was not so much an act of ordinary ‘foundling’ as it was willed into being by the unspoken desire of supportive beer-lovers in Northern California after which they continued to nurture their creation and urged us forward to fulfill the unifying needs of that same beer-loving diaspora from coast to coast and beyond.

The brewery, like most breweries of the time, went out of business during the first year of Prohibition. In 2007, Dan Selis, an avid homebrewer, re-established the brand and eventually relocated the manufacturing and the tasting room to Downtown San Diego in the Historic Wonder Bread Building in the East Village.
Mission started in a humble brewery addition to a restaurant in UTC. We soon outgrew the space and relocated to a shared warehouse brewery in Chula Vista. After a few years, we were ready to head out on our own and secured the old Wonder Bread space that we are currently in.
In arguably the most beautiful brewery space of the most epic proportions, Mission now boasts a 2,500 sq. ft. tasting room in over 25,000 square feet of total space. Original brick and bow trusses give rise to a space that is unlike many others found here in San Diego.
Besides its historic awe, the brewery is unique in that the brewhouse is set overlooking the tasting room. When you visit our space, you will be right in the middle of the action.
This is our only location and all beer is brewed, bottled, canned and kegged on-site.
Mission has been brewing commercially for over nine years. With over 40 National and International awards under its belt, Mission is considered one of the top craft breweries in San Diego County. Show Less",Mission_Brewery

Old Bus is an expression of the humble, steady and free approach that owners Ben, Jimmy and John take to our brewing, cooking and cocktails.
We also actually do spend a lot of time on old buses.
John restored a 1978 Volkswagen Westfalia and spent a summer touring the country. It’s now become his daily driver and our team adventure vehicle. And now, with the help of our Indiegogo campaign, we have purchased a 1971 VW bus fully dedicated to the business. The ""Old Bus Bus"" is used for further adventures, as well as farmer's market trips and beer festivals. It is also available to the community for outdoor parties, events, and catering.

Brewmaster Ben starts with classic styles that are reinterpreted through experimentation. While we love big, unusual beers as much as any beer geek, we strive to balance those with brews that are enjoyable from start to finish, day after day. After eight years of homebrewing with John, our new steam-fired, four-barrel brewhouse from Portland Kettle Works is a big step up for us. But it's still small enough to give us the freedom to experiment with new recipes and ingredients each batch.
In addition to our own beers brewed in-house, our fourteen taps feature a rotating selection of other local craft beers. The cocktail menu is based on fresh, seasonal ingredients, and the back bar reflects our shared passion for whiskey and mezcal. Show Less",Old_Bus_Tavern

We start with a passion for quality craft beer and with a desire to share that beer with a thirsty public.
Taste evolves. Craftsmanship matters. Quality is essential. Choice is mandatory.
We witness these truths manifest themselves again and again in industries from technology, to food, to vacation experiences. Everywhere we look, there is evidence of these four ideals revolutionizing the way we enjoy our world. Beer sits poised on the cusp of this revolution and will not be ignored.
Yellow, fizzy, flavorless suds, peddled by scantily clad co-eds, no longer satisfy the American public. Brewers like Sam Adams, New Belgium, Stone and Karl Strauss have tested the waters. These brewers put their toes in and swam. They defined the need, created the demand and expanded a once flat industry. These pioneers cut a path and laid the ground work for the next generation of brewers to come along and fill the needs of the beer drinking world.
This is where we come in. Pocock Brewing Company is positioning itself to craft flavorful, surprising and exciting beer. Our beer will be enjoyed by drinkers throughout California — locally crafted beer delivered to local drinkers — keeping the beer as fresh and flavorful as possible before it hits the tongues of happy people.

When Korbel decided to get out of the beer business in 2003, they generously offered the brewmaster, Vinnie Cilurzo and his wife Natalie the rights to the brand. Russian River Brewing might be something completely different now if it weren't for this incredible opportunity.
In the early days on the Korbel property, Vinnie not only brewed the beer, but made the sales calls and deliveries as well. Eventually they hired a sales/delivery guy to help with all of that so he could focus on brewing! Korbel planted a small hop field where Vinnie received a ""field"" education on growing and brewing with ""wet"" hops. It was from those amazingly fresh hops, grown just a few yards away, that he made his first wet hops brew, ""Hop-Time Harvest Ale"".
As it turns out, demand is still greater than the supply, but they prefer to grow their business organically while focusing on efficiencies and quality. For now, it is easier to make better beer than it is to make more beer!

Quality, Tradition, Camaraderie; it’s a recipe as old as beer itself and the three main ingredients to our philosophy. It is exactly what drives us to bring the best beer experience to each and every person who walks through our doors, every day. It's very similar to the way malts, yeast, and hops bring the best out of life!
Quality- Think of it as the Malts. It's the Backbone that supports everything and holds it all together, and without holding ourselves to the highest quality, we would crumble. All of our beer is Served Fresh (unless improved by age), stored properly under a tedious eye of temperature control, and served to lines that are not only meticulously cleaned, but properly maintained on a day to day basis.
Tradition- Much likes the yeast in beer we work incredibly hard to evolve with the changing environments and climate of the beer world, but we hold true to our original philosophy of “Great Beer” and “Great People.” We will never give up on our goal to fill our establishments with the best beer from around the world, as well as local, and the best people to represent that beer to the customer.
Comradery- The Hops! The personality and diversity that has brought all beer drinkers together to discuss the new wave of west coast style IPA’s, Pale Ales, New England pale ales.
Remember, a beer is always better when enjoyed with friends and like-minded people.

SARA takes liberty in emulating those memorable beers, their brewers, and the experiences they foster, never forgetting those giants on whose shoulders we stand.
Our approach to beer making is one of whimsy, highly inspired by the Belgian tradition, but also in harmony with brewers all over the world who push against boundaries of style with a nudge, not a shove. Often our beers are barrel-aged, usually in wine barrels, with various yeast and bacteria. As often as not though, Sante Adairius brews beers more approachable and traditional in nature, yet no less flavorful or distinctive.
Owned and operated by us, Adair Paterno and Tim Clifford, Sante Adairius Rustic Ales is our attempt to bring people together over great beer. SARA is an expression of our many years of beer geekery, the rabbit hole of tasting every beer we could get our hands on, and trusting we could contribute to the canon of those beers of the highest esteem.

He made a good living and provided well for his wife and two children. In 2011 he began to home brew beer to enjoy with his friends and family. The beer was good! At the urging of family and friends, Ben closed the mechanic shop in November 2014 and transformed the garage space into a microbrewery.
The mechanic theme is woven throughout the brewery and tap room. Tabletops are automobile radiators covered with plate glass and have automobile mufflers for legs. Overhead lighting consists of mechanics’ trouble lights. A crank shaft from a D-12 Caterpillar is a major attraction and conversation piece. The walk-in cooler is covered in diamond-plate and looks like a giant tool box. The tap handles are made from mechanics’ wrenches.
When the brewery opened in 2015, there were 4 beers on tap. Currently, they offer 11 beers, all with mechanic –themed names such as Rusted Nut Amber Ale, Black Nail Stout, Dull Sickle Hefeweizen, Hot Rod Jalapeno Amber, Burnt Valve Chocolate Porter, and Scoop Shovel Shandy. Free popcorn is available on site, and the Busted Knuckle has partnered with Eugene’s Pizza (twice voted as the Best Pizza in Montana) for exclusive delivery service.

​After a few years of developing our vision and perfecting our debut recipe we have debuted in our home state of Oklahoma and across the Midwest with our flagship beer, Mmmhops, which is a full-bodied delicious pale ale with a unique toasted malt signature and a refreshing hoppy finish.
Our first love is music, and with over twenty years as musicians and entrepreneurs in our band HANSON, we are integrating a bit of that craft into each beer sold by giving away a free song with every bottle.
We also believe that everything you do can be an engine for good to help those in need, so a percentage of the proceeds from all of our beers contribute funds to provide clean water to communities in need.

Our goal is to provide the highest quality beer available in a farm-oriented, family-friendly environment.
Our home on Elm Flats Road in Mayville, NY was once an actual working farm, complete with horse and cow stalls. It has been fully converted into a small batch brewery with farm-related décor. Including 1,600 sf of brewing floor as well as 2,300 sf of tasting/gathering room, we have plenty of space for your enjoyment.
Using NYS and locally grown/produced ingredients, Big Inlet Brewing produces small batch, handcrafted beers designed and brewed by our head brewer, Mike Starks along with brewer John Weise. Mike and John each have more than a decade of home-brewing experience and Mike has also won a number of competitions for his brewing skills.
Randy and Brent are hands on owners who share a common passion – to provide guests with the product (beer) and service that they deserve in a way that displays our dedication to Chautauqua County and Western New York. Ultimately, beer is about a good time. We look forward to making new friends, sharing our beer, and providing that service and environment where you have just that – a good time.

In the middle of the bar, you will see a wall of wooden barrels which will house beer aging inside of them, soaking up the flavors of the liquors which originally lived inside, like bourbon, whiskey, and red wine.

So, a few of us decided to get together and create a company that offers something that may help you get more out of these discussions, and come up with that greater good. Some in our company were born and raised here, and some came to Tupper and saw a lot of hope. Tupper Lakers and the Adirondacks are a proud bunch, and we're glad to be a part of that bunch.
We named our company Big Tupper Brewing because the ski area has always been a symbol of hope. For over 50 years, Big Tupper has played an important role in our community, by introducing the outside world to our area, and by bringing people together.
We hope you enjoy our special brews. And, we hope that it brings more of us together and serves as your inspiration to help with the greater good.

One day it hit them - they had to make beer; full-flavored delicious beer with some surprising limited offerings to discover along the way.
Combining Grandpas’ tradition, a dash of spirited but light-hearted spunk and an old trolley barn, Yonkers Brewing Company was born in 2015. YBC is committed to producing award-winning beers and building a strong community by supporting local partners and many charitable causes.
At the beginning of 2018, YBC welcomed head brewer Ray Girard. He brings over 10 years of experience and innovation to Yonkers. His first beer brewed here was Ray's NE IPA.

Both Great Britain and America claimed the territory.
President James K. Polk tapped into the public mood and the prevalent attitude of manifest destiny in the U.S. that called for expansion into Texas, California, and the entire Oregon territory. The northern boundary of Oregon was the latitude line of 54 degrees, 40 minutes. “Fifty-four forty or fight!” was the popular slogan that led Polk to victory against all odds.
Polk boldly declared to Great Britain that joint occupation would end within one year. The British were confident they could win, but by 1846 they were vastly outnumbered in Oregon by a margin of greater than six to one. In June of that year, Britain proposed splitting Oregon at the 49th parallel. Polk agreed to the compromise, and conflict was avoided. Show Less",54_40_Brewing_Company

Our 20 gallon brew system quickly grew into a 3 barrel system, and we served our award-winning beers — the original Melvin IPA, 2x4 Double IPA, and Ch-Ch-Ch-Cherry Bomb — with sides of Asian street food, kung fu movies and old school hip hop.
After winning Small Brewpub of the Year at GABF 2015, we opened a 30 barrel production facility 45 minutes away in Alpine, WY (pop 750) with the awesome help of the people of Wyoming. Shortly thereafter, we went on to win Brewing Group of the Year at GABF 2017.
Embracing the chaos and riding the wave, Melvin Brewing is now ready to take its world class beers on a worldwide tour, via our lifted border patrol Melvin bus.

The Pacific Brewing and Malting Company formed in Downtown Tacoma in 1897 as a result of a merger between Puget Sound Brewing Company and Milwaukee Brewing Company. Pacific Brewing grew to be one of the largest breweries in the Northwest and the Pacific Beer brand was hugely popular along the entire West Coast. Success was, unfortunately, cut short by state-wide Prohibition in 1916 and Pacific Brewing closed its doors shortly thereafter.
Now, nearly 100 years later, Pacific Brewing is back in Downtown Tacoma. Reformed by a group of local beer enthusiasts with a love of Tacoma and its rich history, Pacific Brewing & Malting Co., complete with the original logo, is once again setting its sights on being one of the premier craft breweries in the Northwest. Our lineup includes 1897 Lager, Dirty Skoog Double IPA, Grit City Porter, Prairie Line IPA, Potomac Citra Pale Ale, and many others.
Our family-friendly brewery and taproom, located at 610 Pacific Avenue (next door to Old City Hall), opened in September 2014. We serve a variety of Pacific beer styles along with snacks, soda, and free juice boxes for kids. Growlers are available to go and beers are bottled and distributed locally.

His beers have garnered well over 50 awards across numerous styles ranging from hop-forward IPAs to sessionable sour beers. Over the last five consecutive years, Mike’s beers have been hand-selected by local craft breweries for larger production and distribution into the local market which continue on to compete in the National Pro-Am competition at the Great American Beer Festival.
Beer & pizza have many traits and basic ingredients in common. Both are deeply rooted in proper fermentation and vast arrays of flavor profiles. Just like beer, pizza is taken very seriously at Resonate: the creation of our Alla-Romana style pizza was rigorous, involving much research, careful attention to detail, the most discerning of palates and the eating of many delicious test pies. The result is not your typical American style pizza. The process to achieve our unique take on pizza requires a 72-hour fermentation cycle for the dough with meticulous care throughout the process.

When Reuben and I took Adam to Bob’s (our friendly, neighborhood homebrew supply store) to pick up his kit, I was expecting to pick up a little tin of “beer mix” and a bucket to brew. We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business. I thought, “Oh great, there’s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month’s time.” Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we’re married, I couldn’t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby. The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!

Everyone always says that if you love what you do, then you’ll never work a day in your life. I guess that makes us the luckiest people in the world because we make beer and everyone loves beer and work is the worst. Also because there’s beer at work. Every day. It’s awesome.
OUR HISTORY
But behind every awesome group of people (which we are) and behind every stellar pint of beer (which we have) is a good story (3 for3!) The Ranville family initially settled on Mackinac Island several hundred years ago, along with French explorers, traders, voyagers, and a bunch of other cool, adventuresome lads and ladies.
We then moved to the mainland, and operated a fishing business in the area where the state docks are now located along the Mackinaw City waterfront. Good times were had, outlandish shenanigans took place, and our happy family grew happier. There’s a lot more to tell, but they are stories better shared over a pint of good brew. We choose to spell Biere the French way as a nod to our ancestors, who settled in the most beautiful place on the planet, and facilitated the opportunities that got us to where we are, which is a pretty amazing place to be!
Don’t be fooled by that fancy spelling, though; we won’t correct you on the pronunciation because we aren’t even sure if we say it right. Good beer and good food. That’s all we care about. Stop in some time, grab a pint (or, you know, realistically more than one) and enjoy! Cheers! Show Less",Biere_De_Mac_Brew_Works

Our original establishment is located in the small village of Decatur, Michigan, our hometown. We have recently, as of December 15th, 2017, opened a second location in downtown Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Before opening Final Gravity Brewing Company, Kevin had been homebrewing for over 15 years, and just saw it more as an awesome hobby. However, as Kevin's son Michael grew up, he picked up the craft as well. The two were asked by the owner of Patchwork Brewing Company to assist in the beer making process, which is how they got their start.

Before opening Final Gravity Brewing Company, Kevin had been homebrewing for over 15 years, and just saw it more as an awesome hobby. However, as Kevin's son Michael grew up, he picked up the craft as well. The two were asked by the owner of Patchwork Brewing Company to assist in the beer making process, which is how they got their start.

Over the next two decades, they built a monumental brewery at the corner of Michigan Street and Ionia Avenue, what is now the site of a state office building. Capitalizing on the location’s ample supply of fresh spring water and a refreshingly drinkable flagship beer, Silver Foam, GRBC became one of Midwest’s largest and best-known breweries.
In 1920, Prohibition brought that success story to a crashing halt. When the bans on alcohol production and sales were lifted, GRBC merged with several other breweries and eventually left town.
In 2012, Mark Sellers, founder of BarFly Ventures and owner of three other area bars, brought GRBC to downtown Grand Rapids, just 6 blocks from its original location. Today’s GRBC opened on December 5, 2012, 79 years to the day after the repeal of Prohibition.

When a group of business people decided to create Jamesport Brewing Company in Ludington, they called on Michael as a consultant in setting up the brew system and choosing beer styles and recipes for their venture.
Today, I realize that I am one of those lucky people who is involved in a career that happens also to be something I love doing.

We don't know about you, but we're really proud of that fact. After the Amendment was adopted, dozens of breweries sprung up across the state, including the original Midland Brewing Company, which opened in 1935 inside an old creamery downtown.
Midland Brewing developed some signature beers like Red Keg Ale, named after the first lumber camp and saloon in Midland County. Unfortunately during the Great Depression times were tough and competition was fierce. Even with its excellent beer, the brewery lasted only a few years.
Midland Brewing Company was reborn in 2010, and our small posse of entrepreneurs are connecting our passion for brewing quality Michigan craft beer to Midland's early history - especially its first 100 years, defined by the lumber, railroad and beer industries. We reopened Midland Brewing company not far from Averill, Michigan, where the Red Keg Lumber Camp sat by the Tittabawassee River.

The next move was to relocate the brewing to a small unit in an industrial park on the south end of town. Brewing for the pub, kegging, and bottling for distribution throughout our great state eventually created the need for more space.
Here we are now, in our own 44,000 sq.ft. building, and we are still trying to keep up with demand! We currently house a 15 barrel brew house with a capacity of over 560 barrels and counting.

The Traffic Jam and Snug, established 1965, is truly one of Detroit's hidden treasures. Known throughout Midtown for our in-house bakery, microbrewery, and dairy, our curiously intimate multi-level dining rooms, and an eclectic menu of made-from-scratch dishes, there is simply nothing quite like The Traffic Jam.
We only use the best, freshest ingredients. We know this because we make everything ourselves. Each day, our bakery turns out a new Bread of the Day, from authentic ethnic crusted rolls and vegetable breads to whole grain sourdoughs and cheese loaves. In fact, head baker Pete Waldenmeyer stopped keeping records of recipes years ago. A shamefully delicious selection of pies, cakes, and cookies are made here too, not to mention our very own hot fudge and ice cream.
Our award-winning cheeses and beers are a local favorite. We actually use the same equipment for brewing beer and making cheese, and we encourage you to witness this unique process from our observation balcony. One popular lunchtime choice is our cheese platter, consisting of three of our finest cheeses, served with premium crackers, fresh berries, and house-made honey dijon mustard.
On December 18, 1992, after a decade-long legal battle, the Traffic Jam became the first brew-pub in the state of Michigan. Since then, we have been brewing an uncommon, ever-changing selection of hand-crafted beers. Take, for example, the Grand Theft Pilsner, or the Java Porter. Available in 14 or 22 oz. pours, or try them all with our 8 oz. sampler glasses. Show Less",Traffic_Jam_and_Snug

While researching Allendale's 150+ year history, we learned about trail marker trees that guided early travelers. Young saplings along trails were bent to create a distinctively shaped tree or branch to point the way to the nearest village, waterway, natural resource, or meeting place. And so, Trail Point name was born.
If you're an Allendale resident, we want to be your frequent meeting spot - a locale to catch up with your community, chat with old friends, and meet new ones. Traveling through the area? We extend a warm welcome, a cold pint, and are happy to direct you within the community. Finally, if you're following the craft beer 'trail', we offer you a glass of the area's best liquid refreshment.

With that idea in mind Jeremy and Natalie Roberts began building the foundation for 903 Brewers back in 2011.
Jeremy Roberts is not only the founder but he is also the head brewer. He spent years perfecting his recipes and letting the community decide what beers they wanted from their local brewery. He fearlessly concocted hundreds of different beers to see what new flavors he might come up with. Not all were a hit, but that is how you find a gem. Do you have an idea for a beer you’d like to try? Let him know, he just might try it out.
903 Brewers officially opened its doors in June of 2013 and introduced to the world The Chosen One Coconut Ale and Roo’s Red Ale. Since that time 903 Brewers has added many more year round beers, seasonals, and special releases. They frequently release new beers so check back often to see what new offerings the gang has come up with.
903 Beers have won many awards but their most prized award came in September of 2015. Their Sasquatch Imperial Chocolate Milk Stout took home a silver medal from the Great American Beer Festival in the aged beer category.
903 Brewers is also a great place to visit. We host trivia nights, movie nights, and Saturday tours. Check the events calendar to see what is happening next. Show Less",903_Brewers

Before Interstate 10 came through El Paso in 1959, State Highway 20, or ""Texas 20"" as it's known by locals, was the main auto route between San Antonio and Los Angeles.
The railroad came through El Paso in 1881, and construction materials like heavy lumber, steel and brick came quickly. Buildings got taller and goods shipped into El Paso traveled by truck to towns and villages in Mexico and north to Santa Fe. Warehouses on Texas Avenue flourished, most with brick walls and wooden rafters.
810 Texas Avenue is where El Paso Brewing makes its home, in the heart of the former industrial district that changed El Paso from a sleepy, dusty little adobe village of several hundred settlers into a western boomtown of more than 16,000 by 1900.
It was in 1900 that Alfred Courchesne established the original El Paso Brewing and Ice Co. to serve thirsty cowboys, businessmen, explorers and gold seekers. El Paso was becoming infamous for being the ""Six Shooter Capital of the World"" and the original ""Sin City."" Scores of saloons, dance halls, gambling establishments, and houses of prostitution opened on the main streets. Eventually, El Paso leaders cleaned up the lawlessness, and Prohibition in the 1920s spelled doom for brewing in El Paso.
Today's El Paso Brewing Company is at historic 810 B Texas Avenue. Show Less",El_Paso_Brewing_Company

We are the city’s oldest brewery, making extraordinary lagers and ales since 1997.

Live Oak has grown since then, but we are still just as passionate about providing delicious old-world style beers that are rarely commercially available. Our special beers are brewed in limited quantities in a small east Austin brewery and are available in fine pubs and restaurants.
Live Oak employs an old-world style of brewing rarely found in America today but practiced extensively throughout Germany and the Czech Republic. A decoction mash, open fermentation, and secondary lagering are essential to duplicate the rich maltiness and unique flavors of central European beers. The results are yours to enjoy.

As the legend goes, a beautiful woman stricken with grief of a lost lover at sea, threw herself from the top of the rock, plummeting to her death. She haunts the Lorelei rock singing her beautiful song, luring sailors to their watery graves. In reality, what these sailors are hearing are the sounds of a very small waterfall at the bottom of the Lorelei rock, accompanied by the sound of the wind whipping around the bend in the river where the rock sits, making the false sounds of a woman singing.

We also have been known to host a homebrew competition where the grand prize is a chance to brew your recipe on our system. Our 2011 Pro-AM received such fanfare that we decided to add it to the group, and thus, Valkyrie was born.
Our Seasonals, such as our Le Mort Vivant and our Walloon, were based on beer styles that were all but extinct, and portions of the proceeds from our Red Cockaded benefit an endangered woodpecker native to our region.

Although we were brewing nearly every weekend, we realized we seemed to never have any beer on hand. We were making five gallons at a time, but consuming 3-4 during the brew sessions, so we never got ahead. Ned went to work building a 10 gallon electric brew rig which we still use today for our test batches.
Now that we were making 10 gallons at a time, we had some beer to bring to events – tailgates, parties, and weddings.

After getting tired of settling for beers that were extreme in taste, flavor and hoppiness we wanted to create beers that everyone could enjoy. We wanted to make a large variety of beers so that everyone could find a beer they could drink. It took a lot of trial and error and sometimes pouring the beer down the drain until we had beers that we liked.
After years of brewing we decided to take our beer to the next level. It took several months to find a place to do this. We knew we wanted to be in West Reading because it is welcoming to small businesses and the community around Penn Avenue is also very supportive. The community is friendly and wiling to get involved in their neighborhood.
The tasting room is all brick that we found under a layer of stucco. This was a wonderful surprise that allowed us to keep the patch work tile floor that was there from the tile shop that was previously in the building. The environment is warm and relaxing. When you walk to the back you can see the brewery through a glass paneled door. The brewery is all stainless steel with a small 2 BBL brewing system.

That's the inspiration for Crooked Tongue Brewing. After a long career as a beer connoisseur in college, Cody Greene began brewing beer in his parents' garage in 2008. Cody's interest in brewing grew and he moved his hobby closer to home — to his own backyard. Here he began studying the craft of brewing, even growing his own hops, researching different methods and techniques, building his own brew house, and eventually building a garage to house his steadily growing hobby. While taste-testing with friends was a definite perk, brewing beer became a family activity with Cody's two children helping brew root beers and cream sodas. Eventually Cody's love of great beer and interest in brewing out grew his garage and he decided to take one huge leap and buy the property that has become the first official home to Crooked Tongue Brewing LLC. Crooked Tongue provides a laid back, relaxing and family-friendly atmosphere, both indoor and out. The business is based on the ideas of good people and great beer.

The brewery sits on a family owned farm that has been growing crops for hundreds of years. Our brewery’s founder, Stephen Ferguson, has owned the land for over 40 years and built its namesake barn by hand back in 1976, exactly 200 years after America’s Declaration of Independence. Now the 40 year old barn has been converted into a brewery to preserve this historic land as a working farm and bring the real flavor of Bucks County to life. Using grain grown right on the farm, Great Barn Brewery strives to brew beer that is uncomplicated, unadulterated, close to its source, and coming from the heart. The idea of simplicity is one of our basic principles. It’s about going back to the land and honoring the ingredients that naturally grow in abundance. It encompasses a fiercely independent spirit, like our forefathers before us, that is the complete opposite of mass produced products. Our philosophy requires that everything is handcrafted with extreme care and attention from basic raw ingredients. When it comes to making beer you need two things: great ingredients and great execution. By growing our own grain and sourcing local ingredients we ensure that our product represents the best of Bucks County. Show Less",Great_Barn_Brewery

""Although the official history of Oakdale began in 1892, the real history of the town began earlier than that. The land on which Oakdale is situated was originally part of a 400 acre tract of land which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted to Judge Hugh Henry Brackenridge on April 11, 1778. In the original warrant, the name given to this land is called Mt. Helicon, a name from Greek mythology, the sacred home of the Muses."" Our logo is a Greek harp with a barley stem in the middle.
We plan to produce a wide variety of American, German, and Belgian styles of beers and also some new and unique brews. More information will be coming soon.

Folklore states, in the 1740’s when early dutch settlers arrived and established a community, one of the first buildings commissioned was a tavern, where they undoubtedly brewed beer. This was quite common in the colonial era, as taverns were very important centers to these small rural villages. It was in the tavern where the most urgent and pressing issues of the day were discussed over a pint of locally brewed beer. Hellertown's first tavern was certainly no different. However, this tavern’s location has become unclear. No one knows exactly where it was.

Housed in the once historic Boyertown Brewery, we’re brewing classic beers with hops grown locally.

We’ll welcome lots of collaborations and fresh new concepts in home brewing and experimentation.

Fast forward nearly twenty years and we’re still crazy about hops and the flavours they impart on beer – our hop store is crammed full of varieties from all over the world, from Australia and New Zealand to Slovenia and North America. But that’s not to say we don’t enjoy playing around with other flavours and styles of beer along the way.
Over the years the awards have kept coming, but on a slightly larger scale, with both YPA™ and Leghorn picking up gold medals at the prestigious World Beer Cup in recent times.
It’s our continued aim to produce the highest quality, clean-drinking beers possible, whilst also continuing to experiment and innovate, as new beer styles evolve and customer curiosity grows.

Four years ago they decided to make their brewery dreams reality. Not long after Sean joined the team and they were brewing and scheming all the time to try and get the plan together. They visited 22 breweries in their “research,” Damon hit half a dozen in Canada for us, and Jason even got a behind the scenes look at one in the tiny south Pacific island nation of Palau. A whirlwind visit to the biggest and baddest beer festival in North America was on the agenda as well, the Great North American Beer Festival. We shared pints with some of the great brewers working today, including a sit down with Mr. Jim Koch himself (founder of Sam Adams). We also sampled quite a few beer styles, studied the art of tasting, and finally had our humble plan together.

Over the past decade, each recipe has been carefully developed, refined, and brewed under the four brick arches of Jamey's 1920 Colonial-style home in East Point, GA.

The focus was to produce world class examples of a wide range of styles, a formula which still rings true to this day.

June 2012 brought Barrier into a new location and a bigger operation (5 vessel 5bbl brewhouse), capable of producing 4000bbls/yr. Then ""SuperStorm"" Sandy made landfall in October and shut Barrier down for 4 months. These were very hard times, but at no point was there a thought to give up. Through fortitude and the local brewing community banding together, we were able get back to making beer in February of 2013. Fast forward to 2018.

Like many other brewers, Jon Cueni started his obsession with brewing with a homebrew kit bought online. He spent many hours honing his craft, while friends and family insisted his beer was good enough to warrant opening a brewery.
Jon & Bren thought Costa Rica was going to be the place to fulfill their dream. Alas, after a 3-week vacation, those plans were dashed. Back to the drawing board, after returning to cold, snowy Ohio from sunny Costa Rica we sat down to decide where to look next. St. Pete / Tampa area was similar in the cost of living as Columbus, Ohio – our hometown. So, in August of 2015, we took a trip down to this area. We visited every brewery that was open. We found ourselves being drawn to Safety Harbor & Dunedin but ultimately we found an amazing space in the downtown Dunedin core.
We are a small craft brewery, 4 bbl electric system, on the Pinellas Trail near downtown Dunedin. We opened for business on November 17, 2016. We feel like Dunedin picked us. We were looking for a city where we could open a brewery and be a part of the community. We love this city because of its friendly community, walkability, proximity to the water, and its burgeoning beer scene. We serve only our own beers. We have wine, cider, soda, and snacks available as well. We are dog-friendly. They are welcome out on our patio. Lastly, Cueni is our surname and it is pronounced Q-knee.

Motorworks Brewing is located at 1014 9th Street West, Bradenton FL, midway between the downtown Riverwalk and the recently renovated McKechnie Field (spring training stadium for the Pittsburgh Pirates and home of the Bradenton Marauders).

Our beers are driven by experimentation and curiosity—we aren’t afraid to brew something atypical, but we also aren’t afraid to dump bad beer. We don’t brew trendy or gimmicky beer; we don’t use food coloring, and you will never see the words ‘natural flavors’ on any of our beers because we don’t use flavor extracts. When we use fruit, we use whole fruit, rather than concentrates or purees. Brewing on the small, artisanal level is our passion, because it allows us to brew the beers we love. We don’t skimp on ingredients or process, and our products take months and sometimes years before they are ready. Our beer is not easy to make and it is very labor intensive, but we think it is worth the effort. We hope you like to drink the beers we like to make!

What started out as a hobby, quickly grew into a full-blown obsession for crafting fresh, ""more drinkable"" microbeer. The positive response and overwhelming demand for their brews pushed them to expand into their new facility and tasting room at 63063 Layton Avenue, Bend, Oregon.
Keeping it local, staying humble and using sustainable practices to create the best tasting beer are the priorities at Bridge 99 Brewery. It starts with using fresh , local hops from Tumalo Hop Company in Central Oregon. After the brewing process, spent grain, hops and yeast are sent to a local ostrich rancher rather than going into the landfill. Also, rather than sending grain wastewater down the drain and into our rivers, it is collected in large totes and used as nutrient-rich fertilizer on a local farm.
Where did the name Bridge 99 Brewery come from? Wanting to build a brand around something unique to the region, along with ""99 bottles of beer on the wall"" singing in their heads, the two set out to find a name. The search was over almost as quickly as it began when they remembered a local US Forest Service landmark, Lower Bridge - also referred to as ""Bridge 99"" - that crosses the Metolius River near Camp Sherman, Oregon.

Briefly abandoned and sadly neglected, we have revitalized the Fort George building producing beer here on site. We hope this brewery will respond and adjust to your thirsts, as we believe in beer that evolves depending on the palates of the people who drink it. Show Less",Fort_George_Brewery

In 1987, the Kucera’s began a small pizza business in the Keno area, and in Klamath Falls, during 1988.
Rod Kucera began investigating the micro-brew business in 1995, and devoted 1996 to converting the former dairy into a brewery, utilizing much of the dairy equipment and dairy barn.

When we tried to come up with a name we kept coming back to inspiration that Charlie Papazian gives home brewers in his famous book ""The Joy of Homebrewing."" Charlie always says, ""relax have a homebrew."" This inspiration led us to talk about what we think about when drinking beer, we called out words like, relaxing, feet up, easy drinking, and then kicking back was suggested. That's when we stopped and said, ""That's it, that's the name, it has to be Kickback."" I hope you and your friends can sit down to a session and enjoy the beers I make.

When the craft beer movement in the United States gained momentum in the early 1990s, there was a noticeable lack of focus on lagers. It’s not surprising, considering that lagers are more challenging to brew, take longer to mature, and are therefore more expensive to create. For two decades Johannes dreamed of building an Austrian-style brewery at the Trapp Family Lodge, and in 2010 that dream came to fruition. A humble brewery with capacity for 2,000 barrels per year quickly attracted attention under the name Trapp Lager, and the brewery received requests from all over the United States. The von Trapp family, who had always been reticent to commercialize their family heritage, realized that they had a product deserving of the family name. The new facility, completed in 2015 under the name von Trapp Brewing, allowed the family to expand beyond their home territory and spread the gospel of craft lagers. Show Less",Von_Trapp_Brewing

The tall pillars reminiscent of a bank are still in place today, as well as a iron bank door that can be seen in the southwest corner of the taproom. If you look above the doorway when entering Dangerous Man, the bank's name is still etched into brick.
Rob, Sarah, and extensive family, friends, and volunteers built almost all of the taproom and brewery themselves. It is a work of love, and family. Repurposed wood was taken from a building in downtown Minneapolis and was used to build the bar and taproom tables, helping to give the space a glowing warmth in the twilight hours of Minneapolis.
Around the bar you'll see several iconic pieces of art, all from local artists. Jake Keeler's ""Bearded Gar"" is painted above the southwest corner, right above the bank vault door, and is defininitely imposing! Almost rasputin-like, the fish demonstrates our penchant for beards and danger; always in that order. On the east wall is a sculpture installation piece by a Peter Geyen. It's surreal, imaginitive, and has an amazing sense of movement and poise as an army approaches a strange shaman, shifting time. Stand under the piece and look straight up for a surprise. On the Northeast wall is another installation piece by Peter, featuring a gorilla skull and several young thieves. Fantastic sense of movement, if not a daring sense of style.

Pull up an authentic steamboat chair and choose from one of several enduring styles, like Pilsener, Dunkel and Wiener. Our beer is the perfect complement to tasty bites from the kitchen, including freshly made sausages, heritage wheat pretzels, and limestone potatoes roasted under a slab of Platteville bedrock. We pride ourselves in carrying on German-inspired cooking traditions using locally sourced ingredients, whenever possible.
Waldmann is a humble, memorable place — full of stories and traditions that just may inspire you to make a few of your own. Show Less",Waldmann_Brewery_Wurstery

While devastation hit hard, something was brewing in the midst of destruction. An old high school friendship rekindled and the passion for making good beer was sparked. Our two brew masters had a solid reputation of homebrewing, designing new beers, and perfecting the American and German classics. When the two began to collaborate and brew together, magic happened and the synergy took their beer recipes to a new level. You could call it a true brewmance (bromance with brews). Behind the scenes stood the rest of the brew crew. Disguised as a rocket scientist, a geologist, an insurance agent, and a cop, these four beer connoisseurs came together and decided it was time to share the love with others. What started out as a simple fantasy was in the process of becoming reality. New beer was invented, dreams were fueled, and plans were made to birth something this town had never seen since the 1800s: a craft brewery. Goat Island Brewing was established in early 2015 on a foundation of friendship and a firm belief that it is never too late to go after your dream. So before you begin to cast your judgement, these old goats know good beer and invite you to experience with them how “Life is too short to drink baaad beer!” Show Less",Goat_Island_Brewing

Good People is now enjoyed by folks in Alabama and Tennessee, most of whom we don’t actually know yet. And, according to BeerAdvocate, a leading voice in the beer community, the four highest-rated beers in the South are ours. We’re honored that people seem to think we know what we’re doing.

Boom.
Whats a trim tab you say? Look no further than the words of a genius published in a 1972 Playboy.....
“Something hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little man could do. Think of the Queen Mary [an ocean liner]— the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab.
It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all.
So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go.
So I said, call me Trim Tab.”

My brewing roots began years ago with a homebrewing kit my father-in-law bought for me. Brewing quickly became a passion of mine, something that I truly enjoyed. Our motto is “Hand Crafted Artisan Beers”. The word artisan refers to someone skilled in an applied art, or a craftsperson. Brewing is definitely an art. We may not be making paintings or sculpting a great monument, but we are creating something unique, from scratch, with our own hands for the enjoyment of all who choose to partake. All of our beers are brewed by hand in extremely small batches to ensure freshness, quality, and flavor.
In addition to our brewery we also have our pub and restaurant located right in the heart of downtown Ripon in an old but newly restored building with original tin ceilings, hardwood floors, and really cool architecture. We have a real wood fired oven that we built ourselves to bake delicious artisan pizzas and we also offer fresh salads, panini, and delicious breads and desserts baked from scratch.

We believe that great beer comes from a commitment to be constantly challenging the perceptions of what different styles of beers can actually become. The second we settle, the second we say that a beer has been taken as far as it can go, we start losing. The proverbial mountaintop exists only in our minds. Always be climbing, always be pushing forward.
The next, and equally important commitment, is to the process. There is serenity to be found in even the most menial, repetitive task. There are always ways to improve yourself and your methods, hiding just below the surface.
The parties, jokes, and fun we seem to be having? We have created our own world in which to reside, and we love sharing it with all those that want to partake. I promise you, there is no greater joy, professionally.
The painfully fleeting span of the human life is much too short and precious to spend it being anything less than the best you can possibly be in your chosen vocation. We love the work we do, for its own sake. We spend every day trying to get better, and we treat the opportunity to give this beer to the people of Maine every week as the gift that it is.

Hours are: Tuesday - Saturday, 12PM to 7PM, and Sunday - Monday 12PM to 5PM.
Gruit (grut or gruyt) is an old-style beer brewed using a variety of botanicals. Before hops were readily available, brewers looked to what they could source locally. We like to think about gruit as beer brewed using one's back yard as a plentiful pantry--varying through the seasons--providing a diverse set of ingredients. We commonly use herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, vegetables and leaves that we forage, source locally, or grow in our garden. Like most brewers, we boil, steep, juice, condition, and infuse plants to capture flavor, aroma, bitterness, sweetness, and medicinal and preservative properties. We use plants in different ways depending on their seasonality or highlighted properties. Our offerings will include beers and gruits brewed with anywhere from considerable to zero amounts of hops depending on the desired properties. Show Less",Gruit_Brewing

He went on to brew at other midcoast Maine breweries for the last 20 years prior to taking the plunge into brewery ownership again.

The building on Aalststraat, on the banks of the River Schelde, has now been standing for more than 300 years.
The original brewing apparatus has been retained and forms part of a living museum. It was around 1900 that Liefmans started filling maturation tanks with black cherries, on a small scale. Local farmers brought their excess crops of black cherries to Liefmans and swapped them for beer.
The taste and colour of this cherry beer has undergone a metamorphosis since then.
One individual who played a key part in this was Rosa Merckx. A highly gifted lady (her talents included ballet), she was closely involved in the brewery’s operations over several decades.
Thanks to her encouragement, the cherry beer evolved into a real success story. She was a severe, uncompromising woman who more than held her own in order to make a difference in the world of Belgian beers.
Liefmans was the first brewery to wrap every bottle by hand in tissue paper. In honour of Rosa Merckx, her signature now appears on every Liefmans label.
Along with today’s master brewers, she still keeps an eye on the quality of Liefmans’ products. Her own personal favourite? Goudenband, in particular, gained a special place in her affections.

Our first step was to create great-tasting beer. Not as simple as it sounds, a lot of time and effort goes into our brews before we release them. As a guide, we took a page from Old Milwaukee’s history book and focused on making a beer so great that it would make Albuquerque famous. Show Less",Nexus_Brewery

Matt Moore began lunch with a simple statement to his sailing buddy, Chance Adams, ""We can buy this building down the street. I want to do something special with it. Let's build a microbrewery."" Chance's response was a quick and plain ""Done.""
With a love for beer and home-brewing, the two friends, 'unbeknown to their wives,' began the process of opening a microbrewery. Each planning session began with a beer and ended with a beer. Motivation from their wives (Kara and Amanda) prompted the start of renovation in the fall of 2010. The Moore and Adams families began their journey into the restaurant business.
The renovation was facilitated with the help of countless friends and family. Matt Murdick offered his skills as a plumber, chef and beer aficionado. Robb Richmiller added his talents in the kitchen and food prep areas. Amanda and Kara supplied capital, project direction and support. After a long project of renovation and paper shuffling, Martin City Brewing Company opened as a brewpub on June 3rd, 2011.
In January of 2014 they opened the Pizza and Taproom along with their new state of the art Brewery. By November of 2014 they were distributing their finely crafted beers locally in the Kansas City metro area.

We invite you and your friends to tour our brewery and join us at the Lager House to enjoy one of our fine beers. Here you’ll find the celebration and atmosphere of a true German Pub right down to our authentic Isar Tankards from Munich. Nearly every German has a “Lieblingslokal”, a place where the host is a friend and there’s always a place at the table. We hope you’ll consider Tin Mill your Lieblingslokal in Hermann.

He made a good living and provided well for his wife and two children. In 2011 he began to home brew beer to enjoy with his friends and family. The beer was good! At the urging of family and friends, Ben closed the mechanic shop in November 2014 and transformed the garage space into a microbrewery.
The mechanic theme is woven throughout the brewery and tap room. Tabletops are automobile radiators covered with plate glass and have automobile mufflers for legs. Overhead lighting consists of mechanics’ trouble lights. A crank shaft from a D-12 Caterpillar is a major attraction and conversation piece. The walk-in cooler is covered in diamond-plate and looks like a giant tool box. The tap handles are made from mechanics’ wrenches.
When the brewery opened in 2015, there were 4 beers on tap. Currently, they offer 11 beers, all with mechanic –themed names such as Rusted Nut Amber Ale, Black Nail Stout, Dull Sickle Hefeweizen, Hot Rod Jalapeno Amber, Burnt Valve Chocolate Porter, and Scoop Shovel Shandy. Free popcorn is available on site, and the Busted Knuckle has partnered with Eugene’s Pizza (twice voted as the Best Pizza in Montana) for exclusive delivery service.
The brewery is open Wednesday thru Saturday from 4pm to 8pm.

When they teamed up with menu guru Jeff Neels, director of restaurant operations, in 1999, the trio had all the pieces to create a truly unique brewing/dining experience.
Together they bought Fort Wayne’s Munchie Emporium with the goal of creating a brew house. These days, Mad Anthony will brew more than 2,000 barrels of beer annually from the tanks located on-site.

From Gabby Blonde Lager to ‘Ol Woody Pale Ale to seasonals like Summer Daze and Snowplowed Winter Ale, Mad Anthony is known for having something on tap for every beer lover.
When coupled with signature tastes like the Politician Pizza or Scooby Snacks, the stage was set for customers that came away satisfied by more than the beer.

After managing Busch & Brandt Brewery in Chicago for over 20 years, he was determined to create a thriving establishment of his own…and settled at the corner of 9th and York Streets.
Here, the Zorn Brewing Company was rumored to have used a spring-fed well to produce up to 15,000 barrels of fresh beer a year, including iconic brands such as Pilsenzorn, Grain State and Golden Grain. Even during Prohibition, the Zorn name survived by using the facility to make soda pop. Eventually, Zorn Brewing Company changed its name to Dunes Brewery and was passed down to Philip’s son, Ron, before closing its doors in 1938.
Today, we have brought that brewing tradition back to life in Michigan City. We intend to revitalize a cherished piece of history and introduced a new series of exceptional craft beers to rival any of the past. We invite you to experience a new sense of excitement to the Elston Grove area, and taste our brews in a warm, inviting, comfortable, and fun new setting.

PBC opened it’s doors in November of 2012 and operated a Nano 1/2 bbl system. At first, Pinetop Brewing Company was just a small tap room with limited production and hours of operation. In the Spring of 2013 James upgraded his brewing system to a 3.5BBL and significantly added to his production capabilities. During the winter of 2014 PBC upgraded again and added two 7BBL fermenters.
In August 2015 a new brewer was hired to help transform the brewery to something special - Arizona's only dedicated traditional Belgian style brewery. The brewer is John 'Cisco' Francisco who was already well known for his dedication to brewing authentic Belgian beers. After just 4 months of brewing the new beers we were awarded a Gold medal and Best of Show medal for our Grand Cru at The Strong Beer Festival which is Arizona's biggest beer festival. Then we became overwhelmed with beer enthusiasts from across the state and decided to also upgrade our food menu and became a gastro pub with a scratch kitchen.
By the end of 2016 our tiny brewing setup could not keep up with the demand and we invested in a 10 barrel brewery which is located a mile down the road from the restaurant. We now are making 14 different Belgian beers and self distributing to Tucson, Phoenix and Flagstaff.

Since Bear was an active dog and on the go, he wanted to create a place where he and his friends could “Come, Sit And Stay”.
Well Uncle Bears’ Brewery is that place. Born out of Bear’s love for craft beer and excellent food, we have created an upbeat, fun atmosphere where friends, family and co-workers can come to enjoy a variety of delicious menu selections & NOW our own locally brewed craft beer.

Our choice in art also involves the ‘30’s, with half depicting the construction of the dam and half dedicated to the many great American breweries that folded during Prohibition. We were also fortunate enough to have the city’s assistance in acquiring dozens of actual pieces of equipment used in the construction of the dam. They can be found throughout the brewpub and beer garden. Our goal was not so much to be a tourist destination, but to create a place Boulder residents felt was theirs.
We currently brew up to six different styles at a time, ranging from rich stouts and hoppy pale ales to our most popular, a light, refreshing hefeweizen served with a slice of juicy orange. Having brewed over 40 styles in the past, we will be continuing to release new beers frequently. In addition, we have some great wines and non-alcoholic choices.

In June of 2008 we ceased kitchen operations and began offering our draft beer around Las Vegas (which was previously only offered at our brewery). Due to our growth in the market, in July of 2010 we remodeled and expanded our brewery to keep up with the demand for our beer in our thirsty desert city.
Our expansion included a 22 oz. bottling line, which we launched our bottles in Las Vegas in October of 2010. Today, our bottled beer is available throughout all of Nevada, Ohio and a few hot spots in Utah. Our beers can be found in Nevada, Utah, Ohio, Arizona, and Vancouver, British Columbia.

Saison is a style that was born in the Belgian and French countryside, traditionally consumed by field laborers. We believe saisons should be dry, relatively low in alcohol, highly carbonated, and thirst quenching.
Our saisons take inspiration from Old World traditions, but also incorporate American and other New World fruit and hops. We emphasize the use of oak and fermentation with yeast and bacteria outside of traditional brewer’s yeast. We use Midwestern ingredients when possible.
Our individual beers are based on concepts and, like wine, will vary from batch to batch. We believe in subtlety of flavor and that saisons are often, though not always, enhanced by a bit of lemonade or wine-like tartness, though not by outright acidity. We plan to create beers that we enjoy, and hope that our community will embrace them too.

The core of Lagunitas came from Chicago, St Louis, Memphis, Walker Creek, and the highlands of Quincy.
The Chicago contingent initiated the brewing and the gravitational effect of its suchness did the rest. We all loved the beer but the mission was larger than the ordinary joy of a hoppy-sweet quaff. It was driven unseen by an urge to communicate with people, to find our diasporidic tribe, and to connect with other souls adrift on a culture that had lost its center and spun its inhabitants to the four winds to wander lost and bereft with a longing to re-enter the light. Beer, we have learned, has always been a good lubricant for social intercourse!
The Lagunitas Brewing Co. was not so much an act of ordinary ‘foundling’ as it was willed into being by the unspoken desire of supportive beer-lovers in Northern California after which they continued to nurture their creation and urged us forward to fulfill the unifying needs of that same beer-loving diaspora from coast to coast and beyond.

Well Owner and Head Brewer Mike Pallen has always had two passions in life; music and beer.
During Mike's youth, his father worked at Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Mike was exposed to the entire brewing process. Although he grew up around beer most of his life, Mike did not brew his first batch of beer until he was attending the University of Wisconsin-Madison. For credit in a Botany class, Mike and his roommate brewed an English Brown recipe. After the experience and receiving an A, Mike was hooked. Shortly after moving from Wisconsin to Chicago, Illinois, Mike received a new homebrew kit from his mom, and thus began Mikerphone Brewing.
During that time, Mike spent his days working in the music industry, promoting and managing bands, licensing music, securing and interviewing top artists for Fortune 500 branded campaigns, and helping run the International marketing for School of Rock. When not working, Mike spent countless hours writing recipes, brewing test batches, and sampling out those batches to whomever would try them and provide feedback. One such person was Gerrit Lewis, owner of Pipeworks Brewing Company.
While helping brew and bottle at Pipeworks, Mike met Drew Fox, Owner and Head Brewer of 18th Street Brewery. Mike and Drew hit it off, so much so that Drew asked Mike to be his Assistant Brewer and help with Social Media and 18th's Kickstarter campaign. Drew also allowed Mike to develop out Mikerphone Brewing and set up shop within 18th Street.
Before Mike could brew any Mikerphone beer at 18th, he was presented with the opportunity to become the Head Brewer at BreakRoom Brewery, a new brewpub that was in the works. It was an exciting opportunity, but one that meant Mikerphone Brewing would need to be put on hold. So Mike accepted the opportunity, and spent a year and half developing recipes and building brand presence for BreakRoom.
As the days went by, Mike realized the best option for him and his family was to relaunch Mikerphone Brewing. Mike purchased a 3.5 barrel direct-fire brewhouse and was ready to ship it up to his hometown in Wisconsin and begin the build out of Mikerphone. Shortly before that delivery was schedule, Steve Miller, Owner of SlapShot Brewing Company, presented Mike with an opportunity; set up Mikerphone Brewing at SlapShot and become SlapShot's new Head Brewer. And here we are today!

That is how he came up with the tag line “Old World flavor with a modern slant.”
Off-Kilter’s calling is to create a new legacy in craft brewing, beer that not only quenches your thirst but can be shared with friends in front of a fire pit with great conversation. Maybe paired with your favorite meal or any other activity you enjoy with close friends or family. Make Off-Kilter beer a part of your next gathering; it will become a tradition.

It’s taking the best that we learned from our ancestors and adding the new millennium culture. Making it different but honoring the beer heritage of those before us.

John Barley sketched out a plan on a return flight from visiting his brother Joe in San Diego. On that trip, the Barley brothers hosted a craft beer tasting party for a couple dozen of their friends. It was on. John put together a full business plan after soliciting examples from breweries he admired across the country and started interviewing brewers. It took one meeting with Tim Marshall, then of Rock Bottom – Lombard, to know he would man the brewhouse. His experience with Belgian-style beers and barrel aging made him the perfect fit for Solemn Oath.
Together, Tim and John scouted locations in Chicagoland. They were looking for a space in the middle of a large population with an underdeveloped local craft beer supply. Naperville was the perfect location.
Solemn Oath leased space in one of the city’s only light industrial parks and worked with the city council to craft a new liquor classification that would allow Solemn Oath to operate as a production brewery with an on-site taproom. As he placed tank orders and Tim signed hop contracts, John convinced Joe to move back to Chicago to be part of the team.
Over the first half of 2012, the team built out the space and in April installed a fifteen-barrel Premier Stainless three-vessel system along with 105 barrels of fermentation, affording Solemn Oath a production capacity of about 2,000 barrels per year. (A barrel is thirty-one gallons.) Before our first brew day on April twenty-first, we signed on with craft pioneers Windy City Distribution and launched with three beers during Chicago Craft Beer Week 2012, including the opening of our Naperville taproom. Our first expansion was completed in January 2013, adding sixty additional barrels of fermentation capacity, bringing our annual volume capacity to about 3,200 barrels.
Along the way we’ve made great friends, like Jourdon Gullett, a trained muralist who does all of our illustration work. A mutant baby? Monsters mid-ticklefight? A bad garage-punk band? He’s got a vision for it. And Michael Kiser, a professional photographer in Chicago who tells stories about the world of beer and the beer of the world on his blog, Good Beer Hunting. Without his photographs, this website wouldn’t be half as sexy as it is. Speaking of this website, how about the talented and creative people at Nelson Cash? Killed it. We have other friends we would name, but we wouldn’t want to stroke Greta de Parry’s ego.
Of course, we couldn’t do any of this without our distributor and the sales reps who ruin any chance of us getting any work done on Friday afternoons. Or the beer buyers, managers, and owners at the most badass bars and restaurants in Chicagoland. And you. That’s right, you, the person who just read 493 words to this point because you want to find out what we’re all about. Thank you. You’re kind of our story, too. We’ll be damned if we know how it all turns out. Show Less",Solemn_Oath_Brewery

After a devastating fire, the owners reconstructed The Hotel in 1879 at its original location at 12 Oak Street. For the next 125 years The Hotel served the people of Southern Illinois providing rooms, food, drink, and entertainment. Its location, situated near the train station, provided an ideal hub for travelers and residents.
By 2005 The Hotel was closed for business and abandoned. A piece of Du Quoin history was at great risk of being demolished, but The Hotel was identified as a historic site and the importance of ""saving"" it was recognized throughout the city. In 2009, renovations began toward the next phase of the building, the St. Nicholas Brewing Company. After years of work, the St. Nick is ready to be a focal point in Du Quoin once more. The St. Nicholas Brewing Company will open its doors this summer as a microbrewery and restaurant. All of our beer will be brewed in house to be paired with your favorite pizzas and sandwiches. We look forward to sharing our love for craft beer with the rest of Southern Illinois!
The owners of the St. Nicholas Brewing Company share a love beer, bicycles, and great food. Our logo brings the past and the present together.

As we reach beyond traditional combinations of water, malted grain, hops, and yeast, we are unapologetically proud to say that we brew extraordinary small batch beers meant to be thoughtfully enjoyed
Ten Ninety is a symbol of the passion we possess for craft brewing and the culinary world. Our name comes from the brewing process itself. Ten Ninety or ""1.090"" is the approximate measurement of Original Gravity for each of our flagship beers. This measurement, taken early in the brewing process, denotes a beer with a higher amount of fermentable sugars than most common beers. In fact, our beers share this trait with most wines. A higher original gravity means our beers are more likely to compliment a fine dining experience in the same way. Sharing good conversation over a meal accentuated by an exceptional beer is a universal experience. Sharing a meal and a Ten Ninety elevates this experience.
We find inspiration from flavor profiles and cultures the world over. Specific foods have inspired many of our beers and will drive our innovation in the future. Most brewers create a beer and then find a food to pair with it. We start with food and create a beer to pair with that food. It is subtle differences like these that differentiate us from the rest.

Unlike a lot of college students, the Wayne County native wasn't satisfied with merely consuming it in large quantities. ​
﻿
He had bigger ideas.
﻿
He wanted to brew it.​
​​
It was after spending a semester abroad in Germany -- where beer-making is a centuries-old art form -- that Paul decided to dedicate his senior thesis to the impact of microbreweries on the American beer industry.
​
Well, the thesis was brilliant, Paul earned his degree, and it finally came time to head out into the world and make a living.
​​
Brewing beer, naturally.​
​​
He started at Great Divide Brewing in Denver.
​​
Then he moved to Lake Placid, N.Y., to join the team at Great Adirondack Brewing.
​
Before long, though, he was back out West -- Jackson Hole, Wyo., to be specific, where he mixed hops and grain for Snake River Brewing.
​
But then Great Adirondack called. They needed a head brewer, and so Paul headed back East.

Almost every beer we make contains a majority of Ohio-grown ingredients by weight (starting with the base malt), and many of our beers are 100% Ohio-grown.

Stephen was in Europe doing research in molecular biology and experienced its beer culture that lead to his mid-career crisis. He started writing about beer, and then tried to open a brewery in Arlon, Belgium but that faltered. He then formed the first beer-of-the-month club in Europe, Beer Around the World. Importing beer into Luxembourg, boxing it up and shipping it within the EU. One supplier of his beers was Wolfgang Stark of Haus de 131 Biere. Wolfgang imported beer from all over the world. He supplied Ngoma from Togo, Flame from New Zealand, and Lapin Kulta from Finland. One day Wolfgang asked Stephen if he would like to make a beer in Germany and using an American marketing theme. It took Stephen just a second to say yes and a day to come up with The Raven. The new company was registered in Baltimore and the new beer was eventually produced in Nagold, Germany and called in honor of Baltimore's Edgar Allan Poe The Raven Special Lager.
In August 2012, we formed a brewing partnership , which allows us to have greater control over our beers and also allows us to expand our offerings. There is plenty of room at the facility for us to grow, solving a supply problem that we have had over the years.
We believe that our customers deserve premium ingredients to achieve that authentic European flavor and aroma. RavenBeer is brewed in Baltimore, Maryland.

The brewery began production in January 2014 and won two bronze medals and one silver medal for their coolship ales (Category: Experimental, Subcategory: Wild Ales) at The Great American Beer Festival in 2014, 2015, and 2017. In 2016, Black Project expanded production with a small addition to the property which allowed for the expansion of their barrel program. This allowed the brewery to evolve from Former Future Brewing Company to only serving Black Project beers.
Every Black Project beer is fermented with microbes captured from the local environment via a coolship or foraged from nature. We believe this creates a beer that is unrivaled in complexity. Our beers are intended to have a sense of place, or terroir. No matter how hard one tried to, our beer cannot be replicated outside of our brewery. In fact, our microbe cultures are purposefully allowed to evolve from batch to batch, creating variations and interesting twists from different releases of the same beer.
We are meticulous about designing recipes and processes that will allow nature to take over and create beers unrivaled in their beauty and complexity.

Having grown up in a family that appreciated good food and drink, Dunn expanded his knowledge and passion for beer during his travels. Dunn eventually returned to Colorado, started homebrewing and went to graduate school. Upon graduation in 1993, when Denver’s craft beer scene barely existed, he set out to found what would eventually become one of America’s most decorated and celebrated craft breweries.
Beginning with a marketing study and a business plan, Dunn saw an opportunity in Denver’s Ballpark Neighborhood to brew uniquely balanced, flavorful beers. With financial help from family, friends and a loan from the City of Denver, his dream of brewing commercially became reality in 1994.
The brewery started small and in the beginning Dunn was the only full-time employee…brewing, bottling and selling to accounts all in the same day. As the brewery grew, the beer spoke for itself. Dunn’s beers were balanced, flavorful and representative of a lifestyle that is uniquely Colorado. While Great Divide’s ethos may be globally-inspired, our beers are distinctly Denver.
Since 1994 we’ve brewed all sorts of exciting beer styles, added lots of brewing capacity and we’ve assembled a great staff. In 2001, we bought our building – which used to be an old dairy processing plant – and set out for over a decade of exponential growth. Show Less",Great_Divide_Brewing_Co

We're a simple brewery that few people have ever heard of, and even fewer can seem to pronounce. Snuggled somewhere in the spectacular high country of the Colorado San Juan Mountains, we brew by the single barrel. We make do with what little we have and make beer with even less. Thus, our beers are continously changing. Not only seasonally but, sometimes whether we mean to or not.
We don't have a mission statement, a marketing campaign, and on occasion, even a clue. We're not interested in being trendy or the newest advertising gimmick. We do however - whenever available - use all natural local ingredients and pride in our brewing process and even in our decorating, which makes us and our beer a progeny of nature, and she can be a fickle mother. We live, work, and brew where we vacation, and at times we vacation on work days instead. We try our best, sometimes with little success, but we do keep trying, and we are here; be it by luck, by fate, by fortune or choice, in where we honestly believe is the place that we are destined to be.

In 2015, we open our Littleton, Colorado taproom and beer garden right on the South Platte River. Saint Patrick’s Brewing quickly became the best craft beer garden experience in the southern Denver metro area.
As 2019 rolled around and times changed in the craft beer industry, we sold our taproom so we could focus on production and wholesale of our delicious brews.

A remnant from forward thinkers of a century past.
Our Brewmaster had only read of steam powered brewing, but had never seen a functional steam brewery. These are very rare indeed. We ventured forth, experimented, and created a one-of-a-kind steam generated brewery. The only on in Canada.
To our pleasure we found our test brews to be distinctively fresh and flavourful.

All of our beers are hand crafted with the freshest ingredients.
With so many great craft beers in Colorado, we know we won't be the only good beer you drink. We want to create award winning craft beers with the highest quality ingredients. Our Story begins with old classics like porters and IPAs while innovating using techniques and ingredients to keep it interesting.
Our vision: At Storybook Brewing our vision is to solidify ourselves as strong contributors to the local Colorado Springs community and those in need. We love Colorado and we love good beer. We want to be a known part of the culture of Colorado Springs, reaching as many people as possible both with our beer and our vision.
Our History: Over 15 years ago, Pete got his first home brew equipment from his wife Lisa and he cooked up his first beer, a Doppelbock. Creating many beers and traveling to many countries in five continents, Pete has always made it a mission to learn about many beers of many styles. Seeing him brew every weekend for years, his wife and daughter convinced him to open a brewery. There was much research to be done and many things were learned from places like a small tap house in Brazil to the world famous beer center in Belgium. Whether it is a black lager in Japan or a Dunkelweizen in Bavaria, every beer savored through the years is part of the heart of Storybook Brewing. Show Less",Storybook_Brewing

Of the many items purchased locally on Craigslist we found our pallet racking, an 11 foot long stainless steel sink that had been used to feed cattle (we scrubbed it, don’t worry), and our 3 inch thick 9 foot long chunk of Kansas white oak sales counter that everyone signs when they visit. Our cash register is a used iPad and the holder is homemade of walnut from Greenwood County. Even the street signs that decorate the sales area are from Kansas. Rest assured, we did pay for them! Everything unapologetically screams “Kansas” when you step into the brewery. That passion we have for our home State also drives us to use quality ingredients in our brewing. Like many Kansans we work hard and expect quality, Walnut River Brewing Company is no different. We’d like to invite you to visit 111 W.

From our light & crisp Love Me Long Time Pilsener to our well-balanced and hoppy Donkey-Hoté Double IPA to our velvety smooth Maple-Kissed Porter – we should have something that delights your palate!
With our restaurant, we adhere to the same sourcing philosophies and love & care in crafting our food as we do our beer. Our kitchen is “from scratch” and uses the freshest of ingredients from surrounding farms – including our own!

Applying a passion for stimulating flavor to inspiration found all around them, they set about their goal: to make tasty beer in the place their tastes were formed. Show Less",Carton_Brewing_Co

In early 2014, the HCSV Foundation Board of Trustees voted unanimously to pursue the development of a small brewery on the Historic Cold Spring Village grounds with the name Cold Spring Brewery. To this end, and in keeping with the mission of the Historic Cold Spring Village, an 1804 three bay English-style Cape May County barn from Upper Township was purchased. Stillwell and Elizabeth Corson, a familiar name in the County, built the classic building. Permission to restore and reconstruct the barn, board by board, and place it on Village property was received from both the Lower Township and County of Cape May Zoning Boards along with approvals to utilize the barn in connection with the proposed brewery. Although the barn/brewery is located outside the Village fencing, it remains part and parcel of the 30 acres that are located between Seashore Road and Route 9 in Cold Spring, containing 27 restored historic structures.
Funding for the project was secured through HCSV Foundation’s fundraising events, donations, memberships, retail sales, corporate sponsorship for programs, and gate revenue. Its purpose is to stabilize the museum for future generations to enjoy. Show Less",Cold_Spring_Brewery

Upon returning to Chicago, Drew found it difficult to get beers that sparked that same feeling he had in Europe. It was around this time that Blue Moon started circulating and it- along with Chicago's Half Acre, started to put Drew's wheels in motion.
In 2012 a Kickstarter campaign was begun to get money to open a brewery and taproom for 18th Street Brewery to call their own. The campaign was well recieved and exceeeded its initial goal. In the midst of brewing and bottling six different beers, 18th was able to find a home in the Miller Beach community of Gary, Indiana.

What started out as a hobby, quickly grew into a full-blown obsession for crafting fresh, ""more drinkable"" microbeer. The positive response and overwhelming demand for their brews pushed them to expand into their new facility and tasting room at 63063 Layton Avenue, Bend, Oregon.
Keeping it local, staying humble and using sustainable practices to create the best tasting beer are the priorities at Bridge 99 Brewery. It starts with using fresh , local hops from Tumalo Hop Company in Central Oregon. After the brewing process, spent grain, hops and yeast are sent to a local ostrich rancher rather than going into the landfill. Also, rather than sending grain wastewater down the drain and into our rivers, it is collected in large totes and used as nutrient-rich fertilizer on a local farm.
Where did the name Bridge 99 Brewery come from? Wanting to build a brand around something unique to the region, along with ""99 bottles of beer on the wall"" singing in their heads, the two set out to find a name. The search was over almost as quickly as it began when they remembered a local US Forest Service landmark, Lower Bridge - also referred to as ""Bridge 99"" - that crosses the Metolius River near Camp Sherman, Oregon.

Stephen and Inez met in New York City in June of 2000. They moved to Tarboro in October of 2002 to open On the Square Restaurant and Wine Store.
In Summer of 2008, they bought the existing building on 526 North Main Street (home of Tarboro Brewing Company) because they fell in love with the property and the location. It had been a longtime dream to begin a brewery, but it had been an even longer dream to make Tarboro a destination town for people of all ages and backgrounds. They felt that TBC could be yet another business to synergize downtown Tarboro and attract more people and businesses.
It wasn't long before they found Franklin Winslow, Director of Quality Assurance a.k.a. Head Beer Slammer at Yards Brewing in Philadelphia and fellow Tarboro native to become a partner and consult on all of the recipes. With the help of many investors and lots of local support, the TBC dream became a reality this past February when they tapped their first beer.
Nana's Roof, a Belgian-style Pale Ale named after Inez' grandmother and namesake who had given Inez a monetary gift to make repairs on the failing roof of the building, was released on what would have been Nana's 97th birthday.
The taproom opening followed in June, and since then, the beer hasn't stopped flowing.

It is believed to have taken its name from a distinctive marking of three notches burnt or axed into trees to blaze the trail. As legend has it, the road was made famous by Jack Jouett’s midnight ride to Charlottesville, VA. in June of 1781. After General Benedict Arnold defected to the British, he sacked Richmond and caused a number of our founding fathers, including then Governor Thomas Jefferson, to seek refuge at Jefferson’s home, Monticello, in Charlottesville, VA. Learning of this, General Cornwallis ordered Banastre Tarleton to ride to Charlottesville and capture the group. Captain Jack Jouett of the Virginia Military heard the sound of Tarleton’s cavalry from his Louisa County home just 40 miles from Charlottesville. Upon witnessing the cavalry pause for an extended rest, he raced the moon-lit Three Notch’d Road to Monticello to warn the Governor and his state legislators to flee Charlottesville. Recognizing their debt to Jouett, the legislature passed a resolution on June 15, 1781 to honor him, and “Jack Jouett’s Ride” became a legendary portion of Virginia’s history.

However, when we look to the future, as our community grows and ages, we see our need for an additional enterprise that supports our community and charities in the years to come.
With the blessing of the abbot, we embarked upon a two-year data-gathering mission. We visited each Trappist brewery to learn everything we could from our European brothers. Beginning at the Abbey of Westmalle, we slowly made our way around Belgium, staying at the monasteries and making friends, receiving good advice and drinking some of the world’s best beer. The final stop of our first trip was the Abbey of Sint Sixtus, brewer of the acclaimed Westvleteren ales; by the end of our second trip and more detailed discussions, we were confident that we had put together a realistic plan for a new brewery. Following monastic tradition, the monks voted and confirmed the project by an overwhelming majority – we would build America’s first Trappist brewery.

This was the second business venture for Corcoran whom had been making award winning wines since 2004. Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia’s first vineyard / brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.
Corcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolsch style, American Pale Ales, IPAs, Imperial IPAs, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more.

Our love for craft beer started in July of 1997 at the Original Saratoga Brew Pub, Saratoga Springs, NY when we were first introduced to a splendid red ale brewed on premises.
We had such a great experience that my husband, the Growling Bear, begun reading and inquiring about home brewing in his spare time and for Christmas that year we invested in his first Home Brew Kit. It was also that same year that we lovely inherited our nickname ""Bear"" and ""Duck"" after a pajama party.
The following year as we were vacationing in Boston, visiting Fanieul Hall, we naturally found ourselves heading to the Samuel Adams Brewery and from then on embarked on a craft brewing tasting trail.
In 2001 we dabbed into the farm ales and wits as we were passing through Belgium on a European vacation and soon found ourselves mapping destinations with a bias on craft beers. Our taste kept evolving as more options became available and our passion for beers deepened.
In 2012, inspired by his love for Bourbon, Chocolate and Vanilla, my husband created Panda Bear, soon to be coined by our very good friend Brian ""Dessert in a glass"". After many tasting and approval by friends and acquaintances alike, Panda Bear became our flagship.

The Jack's Run premise is to represent the history and qualities that the town of Purcellville was established upon in the heart of Western Loudoun County.
Jack's Run was built upon sticking with what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality and customer satisfaction. We offer a variety of specialty crafted beers made onsite at the Jack's Run location.
Why Jack's Run You Ask?
Jack's Run is a creek that flows on the western edge of Purcellville into Loudoun County's historic Goose Creek. The name first appears on a colonial map (1749) that shows the county's first land grants. Although the name's origins are unclear, it is likely that it is associated with an early settler. John ""Jack"" Colvill was granted 1,116 acres west of town in 1740. Jack's Run Brewing Company is a tangible link between Purcellville's historic past and prosperous future.

For us, it’s an obsession.
Ever since we brewed our very first batch, our mission has been pretty simple: create the perfect beer. We’ve spent years tweaking and refining our recipes – a little less malt, a few more hops, experiment with different yeast strains. In the early days, our commitment was so intense that our wives and neighbors thought we might be doing something illegal.
We’re less suspicious about it now, but no less driven to make the best beer possible. MoMac brews a high quality beer that is as well-balanced as it is approachable. Our first taste testers were our friends and family, and they run the gamut from beer lovers like us to curious folks who are interested in something new. We won over all of them, and we know we’ll win you over too.
MoMac is by the community, for the community. We started brewing in a Chesapeake garage, and are proud to give Western Hampton Roads a brewery of its own. It’s more than beer for us; we want to be a place where the whole neighborhood can have fun. That’s why we’ve got a huge bar, comfortable indoor and outdoor seating, a private party area, weekend shows featuring killer musicians, visits from the best food trucks in town, and – yes – even a place for the kids to play.
Come visit us at MoMac for a cold beer and a great time. We can’t wait to share our passion with you.

Pen Druid Brewing focuses on wild fermentation using native yeast collected outside the brewery and spontaneous fermentation. The beer is made using oak mashtuns and a 10bbl copper wood-fired boil kettle. The fermenting is in barrels and stainless; aging is in barrels. The brewery is owned and operated by the three brothers Lain, Van and Jennings Carney who are in the psych-rock band Pontiak.
The brothers have spent nearly a decade traveling North America and Europe, playing music and experiencing the local beer traditions. They've released 10 albums on the legendary Chicago independent record label Thrill Jockey Records. In between tours they would brew beer at home.
The name, Pen Druid, comes from their old family farm which sits on the Thornton River in Rappahannock County, Virginia, just a few miles downstream from the brewery.
In the winter 2015/2016 the brothers isolated their own cocktail of wild yeasts and bacteria from the Virginia Piedmont reflecting the terroir of Rappahannock. And in that spirit of capturing the terroir of the Rappahannock Piedmont, the brothers also began their spontaneous fermentation program which employ two copper-lined coolships.
As of July 2017 All kegs and bottles are naturally carbonated using secondary fermentation in the bottle or the keg - never force-carbonated.
They opened Pen Druid Brewing in August 2015 partnering with Jonathan Staples from Black Hops farm. Show Less",Pen_Druid_Brewing

The Virginia Beer Company is a brewery + taproom + beer garden in Williamsburg, VA. The brewery was founded in 2016 by two graduates of nearby William & Mary, who were joined by a brewmaster out of SweetWater Brewing in Atlanta. Four year-round beers are complemented by a boundary-pushing rotation of limited edition beers including Experimental IPA's, Barrel-Fermented Brett Saisons, and Barrel-Aged Imperial Stouts, among many other diverse styles.
The great variety of recipes available at the Virginia Beer Co. taproom and throughout Virginia, New York, the UK, Europe, and Japan are made possible by a unique production model: a brewery built within a brewery. The large-scale, 30-bbl production brewing system is fully integrated with a custom built, 5-bbl pilot system that allows creativity and experimentation on a regular basis.
In addition to brewing quality beer, the Virginia Beer Co. team is dedicated to environmental sustainability and active philanthropy throughout the Commonwealth. We joined forces not just to share a passion for beer, but to create a community-based and philanthropy-focused force for good in the form of a brewery.

It is believed to have taken its name from a distinctive marking of three notches burnt or axed into trees to blaze the trail. As legend has it, the road was made famous by Jack Jouett’s midnight ride to Charlottesville, VA. in June of 1781. After General Benedict Arnold defected to the British, he sacked Richmond and caused a number of our founding fathers, including then Governor Thomas Jefferson, to seek refuge at Jefferson’s home, Monticello, in Charlottesville, VA. Learning of this, General Cornwallis ordered Banastre Tarleton to ride to Charlottesville and capture the group. Captain Jack Jouett of the Virginia Military heard the sound of Tarleton’s cavalry from his Louisa County home just 40 miles from Charlottesville. Upon witnessing the cavalry pause for an extended rest, he raced the moon-lit Three Notch’d Road to Monticello to warn the Governor and his state legislators to flee Charlottesville. Recognizing their debt to Jouett, the legislature passed a resolution on June 15, 1781 to honor him, and “Jack Jouett’s Ride” became a legendary portion of Virginia’s history.
