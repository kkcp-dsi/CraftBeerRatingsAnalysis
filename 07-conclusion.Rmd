# Conclusion

## Observations

From the analysis, we had some new revelations and also some support for our existing understanding of how craft beer ratings are being given out and the increase in popularity of different beer styles over the years.

-   The majority of the breweries in the country are located in about 10 states with California being on the top with 547 Breweries followed by Washington(274) and New York(273).

-   We thought that ratings will be different by the state for craft beers but the average ratings for the craft beers across the states are following a unimodal distribution.

-   IPA-American seems to be the beer style that most Americans like by looking at the numbers, it does have more beers available than any other style in this country.

-   Since the last 4 years, new beer styles are gaining popularity as we observed more new beers are being added in other beer_styles. For example, each year since 2010-2010-2017 IPA-American is the beer style with a new number of beers added in the year. Since 2018 The first place is taken by New England-IPA. Interestingly Lager isn't in the top 10 list from 2010-2019 but it made the list in 2020 and 2021 by being on 8th and 9th this is interesting because lager isn't considered as a beer.

## Limitations

-   The beer data we downloaded from untappd only gave us popular 24 beers per brewery without an api_access. We got everything we can get without the API-access. And these ratings are as of November 1st, 2021. Ideally, we would like to see all the beers information so we can get more insights.

-   We have missing data in beer_ibu and beer_abv values. we had to drop those beers with missing values while using those variables in our analysis.

## Future Work

-   We would like to request untappd to query their API and have user-level beer check-ins and rating data by which we can also overlay single user rating behavior vs larger population by state, city, or country.

-   We would also like to get data from different social mediums where users give ratings to craft beers and compare results from all the different sources and see if there are any differences in rating behaviors.

-   If possible we would like to get data of ingredients used in producing the beer and probably run analysis on what ingredients presence and compositions make a beer liked more. By doing this we can run a machine learning model to predict beer ingredients and compositions which can be liked by more people.
