# Conclusion

## Observations

From the analysis we had some new revelations and also some support for our existing understanding of how craft beer ratings are being given out and the increase in popularity of different beer styles over the years.

-   Majority of the breweries in the country are located in about 10 states with california being on the top with 547 Breweries followed by Washington(274) and New York(273).

-   We thought that ratings will be different by state for craft beers but the average ratings for the craft beers across the stated is following a uni modal distribution.

-   IPA-American seems to be the beer style that most Americans like by looking at the numbers, it does have more number of beers available than any other style in this country.

-   Since last 4 years new beer styles are gaining popularity as we observed more number of new beers are being added in other beer_styles. For example each year since 2010-2010-2017 IPA-American is the beer style with more new number of beers added in the year. Since 2018 The first place is taken by New England-IPA. Interestingly Lager isn't in the top 10 list from 2010-2019 but it made the list in 2020 and 2021 by being on 8th and 9th this is interesting because lager isn't consider as a beer.

## Limitations

-   The beer data we downloaded from untappd only gave us popular 24 beers per brewery with out an api_access. We got every thing we can get with out the api-access. And these rating are as of November 1st 2021. Ideally we would like to see all the beers information so we can get more insights.

-   We have missing data in `beer_ibu` and `beer_abv` values. we had to fill those values by average values of similar styled beers from the same Brewery.

## Future Work

-   If possible we would like to get data of ingredients used in producing the beer and probably run analysis on what ingredients presence and compositions makes a beer liked more. By doing this we can run a machine learning model to predict beer ingredients and compositions which can be liked by more people.

-   We would like to request untappd to query their api and have user level beer check-ins and ratings data by which we can also overlay single user rating behavior vs larger population by state, city or country.
