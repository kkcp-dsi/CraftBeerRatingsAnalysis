# [Craft Beer Ratings Analysis](https://kkcp-dsi.github.io/CraftBeerRatingsAnalysis/)

As we both are Craft Beer Enthusiasts, we decided to analyze ratings
that were given out to the beers from all the independent breweries in
the country because we've always suspected the ratings in different
regions of the country may not follow the same pattern, In addition, we
would like to investigate the connection between the popular beers and
ingredients and see if we can "predict" (not as in ML sense) a beer will
become popular by looking at its hops and ingredients.

### To formulate our questions below,

1.  Find out if there is any correlation between the location of the
    brewery and the ratings that a brewery is getting
2.  Find out the correlation between ratings and ingredients used in the
    beer.
3.  Find out the correlation between beer styles and the kind of ratings
    they receive.
4.  As a bonus question, it would be nice to find out the highly rated
    styles of beers in each state because it would guide us in hunting
    the best beers in the future.

To answer these questions, we've obtained data from two sources
[OpenBreweryDB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) and
[Untappd](https://untappd.com/), which we will describe in detail in the
following sections. We are still working on obtaining the ingredients of
beers, depending on whether or not we will actually acquire the data,
our questions may be subject to changes.
