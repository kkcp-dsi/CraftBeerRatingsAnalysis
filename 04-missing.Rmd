# Missing values

Too find out the missing values in our cleaned data sets we used a missing_value_plot function we created as part of our course assignment.

## Missing Values in Beer Dataset

```{r}
source("analysis_notebooks/plot_missing.R")
plot_missing(cleaned_all_beers, shortenNames = T)
```

## Missing Values in Brewery Dataset

```{r}
plot_missing(cleaned_all_breweries, shortenNames = T)
```
