Unfortunately, the D3 visualization is getting cut off after being rendered in the book, one would have to scroll up and down like crazy to see it. Therefore we decided to move the D3 visualization to vizhub, which can be found at <https://vizhub.com/ChaoPang/aa1efcb807334bf5b716f2a5a0c5c3a7?mode=full>.
