According to the Brewers Association (BA), an industry group of mostly small, independent brewers, there are more than 8,000 craft breweries in the U.S. Nearly 4,000 of them opened between 2015–2020. At first We didn’t have a good opinion on Beers, We used to think Beers is much bitter compared to other available alcoholic beverages. Given we did not get to try different Beers from Craft brewers as they are not easily available when compared to Mass produced beers. With gradual incline in craft beer community craft brewers started organizing Beer Festivals and started making craft beers available in multiple locations, that’s when got to try different styles of beers and it changed our perception altogether. we began to try more craft beers and see that those around us were drinking them too. As the community started to grow and we were trying different kinda of beers bunch of mobile applications were released which will let you check in a beer you are having and lets you give you rating for that beer. This kind of helped the community to grow and also help fellow craft beer enthusiast to find new styles of beers from different breweries and identify new breweries. As we both are Craft Beer Enthusiasts, we decided to analyze ratings that were given out to the beers from all the independent breweries in the country because we’ve always suspected the ratings in different regions of the country may not follow the same pattern. 1.1 To formulate our questions below, Find out if there is any correlation between the location of the brewery and the ratings that a brewery is getting Find out the correlation between beer styles and the kind of ratings they receive. As a bonus question, it would be nice to find out the highly rated styles of beers in each state because it would guide us in hunting the best beers in the future.
