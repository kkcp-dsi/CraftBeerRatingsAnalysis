[["index.html", "Craft Beer Ratings Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Craft Beer Ratings Analysis Krishna Kalluri, Chao Pang 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction Beer is an everyday drink that we are all familiar with, the classic impression of a beer such as Heineken and Budweiser is that it has a light body, a refreshing and slightly bitter taste. We believe all of us share a similar experience where we tried a sip of beer for the first time and only got disappointed by it. Every since that trauma, the question would automatically pop up whenever we see other people consume beer with delight, why would people love it? Beer is normally portrayed as a cheap, easy to access, and down to the earth type of beverage, it never received the attention that wine has been enjoying in the past decades. Both of us felt the same way when we first started drinking beer it’s more of a way to get you into the party mood and sometimes we would drink for effect rather than the taste. That changed about 5 years ago when we first got exposed to craft beer and we fell in love with it immediately, and our craft beer journey started. Before we dive into the investigation of the craft beer, let us get the definition of craft beer out of the way first. Craft beer is defined as a beer made by a brewer that is small, independent, and traditional. According to the Brewers Association (BA), an industry group of mostly small, independent brewers, there are more than 8,000 craft breweries in the U.S. Nearly 4,000 of them opened between 2015–2020. With steady growth in craft beer community, craft brewers started organizing beer festivals and making craft beers available at multiple locations, that’s when people got to try different styles of beers and this changed our perception altogether. Since a few years ago, a few online websites and phone apps were developed for people to share their experience and knowledge about craft beers. Specifically, there are a few well-known beer websites that motivate social drinking such as Untappd and BeerAdvocate (similar to IMDB), where people could find the information on beers, give their own ratings to the beers and also leave comments, and this actually generated a lot of valuable data. For example, the beer apps could leverage this data for developing beer recommendation systems and predict what is going to be the next popular beer? Despite the data is being collected by those organizations and companies, this data is still publicly available on their websites or through their own API endpoint. As we both are craft beer enthusiasts and on a mission of drinking the best craft beers in the US. Due to the sheer large number of breweries and beers available nowadays, it would be impossible to try every one of them, therefore we would have to apply some data-driven approach to help us identify good beers more efficiently. Although “what is a good beer” is a highly subjective question, there is some census among the beer geeks in terms of what beer styles are preferred and what beers tend to get higher ratings. We have been wanting to conduct some beer analyses to understand the landscape of the craft beer industry. Doing so will allow us better understand our own tastes, and enable us to apply a data-driven approach for beer hunting. And this final project gives us an opportunity to do just that. In this project, we are going to apply the EDAV techniques to the beer rating data (will be discussed later in the data source section) in conjunction with our beer knowledge hopefully, we will gain some new insights that we didn’t previously know. Specifically, we decided to analyze the beer styles, beer characteristics, regional origins, and the corresponding ratings given out by users, we have designed a few starter questions to get us started shown below, however, as we dive into the data deeper, the questions will definitely go beyond the scope defined here in the later chapters. To formulate the starter questions, Where are the breweries located across the US? Which of the states have the most breweries? Is there any correlation between the region of the brewery and the user rating? Do different states tend to brew certain beer styles? Is there a correlation between beer styles and user ratings? Do certain beer styles tend to be rated higher than other styles? What traits of the beers tend to receive higher ratings? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 OpenBreweryDB  2.2 Untappd 2.3 Web Scrapper", " Chapter 2 Data sources To answer these questions, we’ve obtained data from two sources OpenBreweryDB and Untappd, which we will describe in detail in the following sections. We are still working on obtaining the ingredients of beers, depending on whether or not we will actually acquire the data, our questions may be subject to changes. 2.1 OpenBreweryDB  Open Brewery DB is a free dataset and API with public information on breweries, cideres, brewpubs, and bottle shops. We downloaded lists of breweries per state using the OpenBreweryDB API. List Breweries API We used the brewery names downloaded from OpenBreweryDB as queries to get the list of beers and their corresponding aggregated rating information from the Untappd. 2.2 Untappd Untappd is a social network for beer enthusiasts that allows its users to check in as they drink beers, share these check-ins, and option to rate the beer they are consuming, earn badges, share pictures of their beers, comment on checked-in beers. It also allows Breweries to officially post the beers that they produce. (paraphrased the definition from Wikipedia). 2.3 Web Scrapper We built a parser to get the list of beers from untappd using Python as we started scrapping data earlier than when we were introduced to web scrapping in R. Our web scraper uses beautiful soup a library in python to scrape the data from web pages. The workflow of the web scrapper is as follows: We used the downloaded a csv file from List Breweries APIthen filter the breweries list from the csv for the state we are trying to download the data for. The brewery name downloaded from OpenBreweryDB in some cases is not the same as the one used in untappd, we used the untappd search function to resolve the brewery name first, the scraper opens untappd search bar to find each breweries page on untappd and opens a brewery page. Once the brewery page is found and opened scrapper goes to page source and searches for div class beer-list and distinct-list once it finds the div class it expands the div class looks for another div class beer-item and gets beer_url, beer_name, beer_style, beer_desc, beer_abv, beer_ibu, beer_average_rating, beer_num_ratings, beer_added and adds everything to a CSV file. For the Brewery data we run a similar scrapper to get brewery_id, average_rating, num_of_ratings, num_of_beers, total_check_ins, unique_user_check_ins, last_four_week_check_ins, brewery_desc and adds everything to a csv. Using this web scrapper we scraped the rating information for the top 24 most popular beers for each brewery on untappd for all the states in US. then retrieved the top 24 most popular beers associated with that brewery. To use the web scrapper and download the data try following the below steps: $ cd brewery_beer_parser $ pip install -r requirements.txt $ python3 beer_scraping.py -i data/breweries.csv -o brewery_beers/ -s &quot;New York&quot; Once the scrapping is done the data for New York outputs as following All the beers per brewery will be exported to -&gt; brewery_beer_parser/brewery_beers/New_York/*brewery_name.csv All the breweries that the parser could find the beers for will be exported to -&gt; brewery_beer_parser/brewery_beers/New_York_brewery_info.csv Once we repeated this step for all the states we manually copied the state_brewery_info.csv to brewery_beer_parser/Breweries/ ** We did check https://untapped.com/robots.txt to see if scrapping is permitted. They do not have any restrictions under user agents. And we also checked their user agreement. There weren’t any rules about getting data for the list of beers. They only mentioned rules about obtaining user data. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Beer Ratings Data: 3.2 Brewery Ratings Data:", " Chapter 3 Data transformation To merge all the beer ratings data downloaded by the web scrapper into a single CSV file and brewery ratings data downloaded by the web scrapper into a single CSV, we used a python script CraftBeerRatingsAnalysis/brewer_beer_parser/data_merger.py available in the repository. To run the data merger and save the merged csv files into data folder follow below steps. $ cd CraftBeerRatingsAnalysis/brewery_beer_parser $ python3 data_merger.py ** We Added State and Brewery name to beer dataset using the in order to make it easy for us to join brewery data to beer data in case if we needed that in our further analysis.

We can ignore beer_desc column as that column will not help in out analysis. In case of beer_abv and beer_ibu we are going to to remove the null value rows while utilizing these variables in our analysis as we cannot add the data to the missing rows using any of the generalization methods. beer_ibu and beer_abv can tell a lot about a beer taste so we do not want to drop these columns as well. 4.2 Missing Values in Brewery Ratings Dataset The more percentage of missing values in the cleaned_brewery_dataset is in latitude and Longitude columns. We are ignoring these columns as we have other columns we can utilize to get spatial maps namely city and state. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Where are the breweries located? 5.2 What kind of beer styles are most popular across the US? 5.3 Do people rate beers/breweries differently across the US? 5.4 What are the popular beer styles? 5.5 What are the highly rated beer styles? 5.6 What are the best breweries and what beers are they making?", " Chapter 5 Results In the results section, we are going to start by exploring the brewery data. There are a few angles that we can go about this. Firstly, we will explore the distribution of the breweries across the US?; Secondly we will look at what styles of beer are most popular in different states because we think different states tend to brew or specialize in different styles. Last but not the least, we will investigate whether there is a difference in terms of the user rating behaviors across states because we suspect that people from different states might have different rating behaviors. After exploring the brewery data, we will look at the beer data, and the specific traits of the beers we are going after include beer style, beer alcohol by volume (ABU), beer international bitterness units (IBU), average user ratings, the big question is that why are certain beer styles getting attention and better ratings than others? We will aim to answer this question using a series of plots to understand different aspects of the beer data. Total Beers in Beer Ratings data: ## No.of Beers: 124916 Total Breweries in Brewery info data: ## No.of Breweries: 5015 5.1 Where are the breweries located? Let’s first take a look at a sample of the brewery data below. The dataset contains the brewery name, description, address, geo coordinates, average user ratings of the brewery (calculated by the average rating of all beer ratings), the number of beers, the number of ratings given the brewery received in total, and etc. When you click on each state, a popup window will appear to show additional information such as the number of breweries, number of beers made, the average brewery rating for that state. Based on this map, it’s clear to see that most of the breweries are located in the northeast region, west coast, and Texas and Colorado. In particular, California has the most breweries (547 in total), which surpasses the runner-up Washington state (274 in total). If you want to have a full craft beer experience, I guess California would be the place to go! We used tigris to get spatial data for state boundaries in US and t_map for generating an interactive map to show the number of breweries across the US. 5.2 What kind of beer styles are most popular across the US? Now that we know which states are making more beers than others, let’s find out what beer styles are popular in each state. For this, we will need to look at the beer dataset, so let’s take a look at the sample of the data first. Although there are quite a few columns in the data, we will focus on state and beer style columns to answer this question. Due to a large number of beer styles in the dataset (1353 in total), we decided to only focus on the top 20 most popular beer styles across the country to avoid overplotting. Another reason is that a lot of values in the beer style columns are not actually beer styles, those values are an either very specific type of a beer style such as Kali’s Kolsch or a beer name that is misplaced in the beer style column such as Crimes of Calculations Fermented In Tempernillo Barrels. We decided not to compare the absolute frequencies across states due to the fact that states such as California and New York have way more breweries than states like Mississippi, the fills associated with those dominant states would overshadow the other states in a heatmap. To work around this issue, we calculated the relative frequency of the beer styles for each state and used it as the fill-in heatmap. And this is a reasonable decision because we just wanted to see what types of beer are more popular in different states. The x-axis is ordered by the popularity of the beer style and the y-axis is ordered by the number of breweries in the state. This heatmap clearly shows that IPAs are the most popular beers across the country with American IPA and New England IPA (NE IPA) and Double IPA (DIPA) leading on the popularity list. In particular, American IPA is the most dominant beer style in most of the states with a few exceptions. For example, breweries in Massachusetts and Connecticut tend to brew more New England IPAs, whereas Vermont and Rhode Island focus more on Double IPAs. In addition, it seems that states with more breweries tend to brew the popular kind of beers such as IPAs and the states with fewer breweries do not follow the trend and brew all kinds of styles. What stood out to us is that Fruited Sour is the most popular beer style in both North Dakota and South Dakota. What the heatmap has revealed actually corroborates with our experience, for instance, New England IPA first took off in the east coast such as in Massachusetts, in which the two of the best breweries TreeHouse and Trillium are located, it’s not too surprising for us to see NE IPA as the most dominant beer style there. 5.3 Do people rate beers/breweries differently across the US? One of the questions we have long suspected is that people have different rating behaviors across regions, and this question was actually motivated by a conversation with our beer friends in the Netherlands, where our Dutch friends criticized that Americans always give high ratings to beers whereas Dutch people are more objective when it comes to beer rating, as a consequence, American beers tend to receive high ratings than the Dutch/European beers. It was quite an accusation and at the same time an interesting hypothesis, so this idea has been stuck with us for a long time, now it’s time to put it to test! Unfortunately, the data we’ve collected is only limited to the US, but the good news is that the same idea still applies to this data, therefore we decided to check whether people across different states have slightly different beer rating behaviors. So are people from certain states more generous or strict with ratings? To answer this question, we will go back to our brewery data, where it contains the rating of every brewery (calculated as the average of all beer ratings) from every state, we could easily dump all of the brewery ratings in ridgeline plot by the state to look at rating behaviors across the country. To avoid overplotting, we will only show the top 20 states with the most breweries in this analysis. Apparently, most of the states follow a uni-modal distribution, and their peaks are centered around the same rating, we don’t observe any differences in terms of rating behaviors across the states. So this observation contrasts with our Dutch friend’s hypothesis, perhaps he is wrong? After some serious pondering, we think our dear Dutch friend might be biased in their assessment, let’s try to explain the rationale here. Our Dutch beer friend is a beer connoisseur and is on a mission to drink the best beers in the world, he has had more than 8000 unique beers at the time of writing based on his Untappd profile, our theory is that the American beers he finds at the local beer stores in the Netherlands or beer ordering websites only carry the best American beers, in addition, he is most likely only looking for American beers with high ratings and blatantly ignoring those with low-ratings, as a consequence, his sample of American beers might be biased towards the high rating ones. To test this theory, we are going to look at the same data again, however, this time we will simulate our friends’ beer purchasing behavior where one would only order beers from the top 50 most highly rated breweries of each state. Now we can clearly see that there is a difference in terms of the distribution of the brewery ratings across the top 20 states. This confirmes our hypothesis about our friend’s biased assessment of the American beers, and we don’t think there is a regional difference in terms of the beer rating behaviors. 5.4 What are the popular beer styles? Now let’s take a look at the popular beer styles across the US. We define popularity as the number of beers associated with the corresponding beer styles. We do want to point out that a popular beer doesn’t necessarily get a high rating and it only means this beer style is brewed/consumed more by people. The below Cleveland dot plot shows that American IPA is the most popular beer by far compared to other styles on the popularity list. 5.4.1 What makes IPA so popular? Naturally, the next question is that what makes IPA so popular? Why do people love it so much? To answer this question, we will compare its beer characteristics (IBU and ABV) with other beer styles. To avoid over plotting, we decide to group all IPAs together, all sour styles together, and also lump all stouts and porters into a single category called Stout &amp; Porter, we will leave out other beer styles in this analysis for now, when we get to the D3 interactive component, we could look at the same type of information much more clearly. As we can see from this scatter plot, the IPAs are more bitter than other beer styles, in addition, their alcohol percentage is higher than Sour but lower than the Stout. It looks like people prefer beers that are bitter (hoppy) but not too strong in terms of the alcohol content. This makes sense because IPAs are famous for their hoppiness, despite the high bitterness level, IPAs are normally very fruity at the same time due to the use of special hops in IPAs. Overall, they are relatively easy to drink and most people could accept them for the first time. On the other hand, sour beers, porters, and stouts are considered as “advanced beers”, which might take newcomers some time to develop the appreciation for. When we portray the craft beer landscape, it could be thought of as a pyramid, where lagers and IPAs are on the bottom and everyone could have easy access to it. As you climb the pyramid, Stouts and Porters would be the next level challenge, eventually, once you reach the top of the pyramid, you would finally appreciate sour beers. 5.4.2 Does popularity change over time? Now we’ve established that IPAs are the most popular beer style by far, has IPA always been that popular? Does the popularity change at all over time? Because based on our experience, we know new beer styles are coming out all the time, breweries are quickly adapting to brew those beers to capture the momentum of the new beer styles. So let’s look at the popularity over time, again the definition of popularity remains the same, which is defined as the number of beers associated with that particular beer style. Wow! Pretty interesting, apparently three beer styles including New England IPA, Double New England, and Sour - Fruited took off recently after 2016. We could see New England IPA surpassed American IPA at some point. Porter used to be popular between 2012-2016 but its popularity started to come back down. Although this gives us a rough sense of beer popularity over time, it doesn’t tell us the exact popularity rank of each beer style, and how the rank changes. To do that, we created an alluvium diagram below to show the popularity rank of the most popular beer styles by year. Again we only included the top 10 beer styles in this analysis to avoid overplotting. In addition, it’s important to mention that the top 10 most popular beer styles at all time may not be the most popular beers in a specific year, so it’s perfectly normal to see more beer styles in this alluvium diagram than the previous popularity plots in the same section. Voila, this is cool! We could see the exact ranks of each beer style over time by year. Now we know New England IPA surpassed American IPA and has been the most popular beer style since 2019. Sour was only ranked 9th in 2018 but moved up on the list to the rank 3rd in 2019. Farmhouse Ale enjoyed its popularity from 2012 through 2019, then fell out of the top 10 most popular beer styles in the following year, but made it back to the list in 2021. Red American Amber also had a similar fate where it remained popular from 2010 till 2017, eventually falling out of favor in 2018. Imperial Stout is an interesting case where it was ranked 9th in 2010 and disappeared in the subsequent years, it did make its comeback in 2015 and ranked at 6th and remain on the popularity list. Milkshake IPA was a once super hyped beer style that made its short appearance on the list in 2019 and 2020. Surprisingly, American Lager took a spot in both 2020 and 2021 and ranked at 8t and 9t respectively, Lager (e.g. Budweiser) used to be considered “uncrafty” by the craft beer geeks, apparently, brewers started making tweaks to the traditional recipes to make it more interesting. 5.5 What are the highly rated beer styles? So far we have looked at the popular beer styles, however, as stated previously a popular beer style doesn’t always receive a high rating, it only suggests that people are drinking this style of beer a lot more than other styles. Okay now, let’s find out the most highly rated beer styles, we are going to show this using a boxplot. Again we will limit this analysis to the top 20 most popular beers. This is interesting! The most deserved beer styles are New England IPA (including the Double version), Stout (including Imperial Stout and Milk Stout), Sour (Including Sour - Fruited, and Sour - Other), and also Double IPA. The most popular beer style American IPA is not rated very favorably, on top of that, it has a lot of outlines on the left, indicating there are a lot of badly rated American IPA beers. Although the median rating of the Farmhouse Ale is not very high, it seems to have a lot of outliers on the right side, suggesting there are a lot of high-rated Farmhouse Ales. 5.5.1 What makes a beer more desirable? We couldn’t help but wonder why some beers are rated higher than others, perhaps the highly desired beers share the same characteristics? If so what are those characteristics? We set out to answer this question by looking at beer IBU and beer ABV. Before we jump into the analysis, we want to clarify one thing, which is that different beer styles have fundamentally different characteristics, e.g. Imperial Stout is inherently more alcoholic and sweeter than American IPA, so it would inevitably introduce some noise if we treat all beer styles the same. As seasoned Untappd users ourselves, we would use different benchmarks when it comes to rating different beer styles. Due to this reason, we decided to focus on IPA styles only for answering this question (defined as the beer styles that contain the mention of IPA). We used our beer experience to discretize beer IBU, beer ABU, and beer rating using the following rules, and then create a mosaic plot. If beer ABV value &lt; 6% then low &gt;= 6% and &lt; 8% then median &gt;= 8% then high If beer IBU value &lt; 30 then low &gt;= 30 and &lt; 50 then median &gt;= 50 then high If beer rating value &lt; 3.6 then low &gt;= 3.6 and &lt; 4 then median &gt;= 4 then high The mosaic plot shows that IPAs with higher ABVs tend to receive a higher rating. In addition, the IPAs with low IBUs tend to get higher ratings as well. In other words, people tend to prefer a strong but not too hoppy IPA (hopefully very fruity), this actually makes sense to us because we all love to drink for both flavor and effect at the same time. 5.6 What are the best breweries and what beers are they making? We have looked at the popular beer styles and their corresponding ratings. The next question is very relevant for us because we really want to know what the best breweries are and what they are making, this will facilitate us in our beer hunting adventure. However, there are so many breweries in the dataset, we will limit this analysis to the top 50 most highly rated breweries across the US. It looks like most of the top breweries are making a lot of IPAs at the first glance, this actually corroborates with what we’ve observed so far, which is that IPAs are the most popular beer styles and some of the IPA styles (New England or Double IPA) have the best ratings in the US. There are some all-around breweries such as Cypress Creek Southern Ales that brew all kinds of beer styles. On the other hand, more than half of the top breweries seem to specialize in certain beer styles, which is probably the reason why they are so good at what they are doing. For example, Trillium, Treehouse, and Other Half only focus on IPAs, whereas breweries like Side Project, and Ladd &amp; Lass brewing focus on the sour and farmhouse styles. We do want to emphasize the fact that we only scraped the top 24 beers for each brewery due to the limited information Untappd allows us to pull, however, we think 24 beers could be a good proxy for all beers of each brewery because the beers from the same brewery do not deviate too much from what they’ve done in the past. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Instructions", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The purpose of this D3 visualization is to better understand the landscape of the craft beer industry. Specifically this visualization is primarily motivated by several questions shown below, What are the popular beer styles? What beer styles are more popular across different states? What are the characteristics of each beer style? why are certain beer styles better rated than others? The D3 visualization combines several plots together including the beer style rating density, beer style popularity over time, beer ibu density, beer abv density, and beer style production by state. Although some of the plots have been shown individual in the results section of our book, we believe looking at the data holistically could give us a better understanding of the data. To avoid overplotting, we’ve only included the top 20 most popular beer styles in this visualization, which is defined as the number of beers associated with that particular beer style. 6.1 Instructions There are two interactive components in this visualization including: A multi-select dropdown box that allows users to add more beer styles to the plots. A beer rating slider for including beers with a specific rating range, the range is cut off at 2.0 on the lower bound because there are almost no beers in that range. In addition under the dropdown box, we included a checkbox as a shortcut for users to include all beer styles in the plots. By default, American IPA, New England IPA, and Sour - Fruited are selected and the rating slider contains the full range of the ratings. At last, we want to make a comment about density plots, where the underlying density function interpolates the missing values therefore the density plots span the ratings that are not selected by the rating slider. Unfortunately, the D3 visualization is getting cut off after being rendered in the book, one would have to scroll up and down like crazy to see it. Therefore we decided to move the D3 visualization to vizhub, which can be found at https://vizhub.com/ChaoPang/aa1efcb807334bf5b716f2a5a0c5c3a7?mode=full "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Observations 7.2 Limitations 7.3 Future Work", " Chapter 7 Conclusion We initiated this project with a bunch of specific questions in mind to help us understand the craft beer industry. As we were diving deeper into the data, we came up with new questions along this journey and expanded our results. To recap, we started out our analysis by investigating the brewery distribution across country, then looked at the popular beer styles in each state. Next we investigated whether there is a difference in people’s rating beer ratings, and eventually we looked at what makes specific beers/breweries more favorable. The analyses we’ve done so far not only confirmed our pre-existing beliefs about craft beer but also provided some new insights that we didn’t know previously. In addition, the interactive visualization allows us to look at beer data from different aspects at the same time holistically, which enabled us to answer unplanned questions on the fly. 7.1 Observations The majority of the breweries in the country are located in about 10 states with California being on the top with 547 Breweries followed by Washington (274) and New York (273). We long suspected that the beer rating behaviors would be different across regions (people from certain regions are more generous and strict), however, the brewery ratings regardless of the regions seem to follow a uni-modal distribution and center around the same median, suggesting people rate beers in a similar fashion. American IPA is by far the most beer style at all time and had been ranked 1st from 2010 until New England IPA took over in 2019. Despite its popularity, American IPA is not the most highly rated beer style, this finding suggests that American IPA is an easy to drink beer and people might prefer it for its popularity and availability. In the past 4 years, new beer styles started gaining momentum in the beer community as we observed more new beers being added in other beer_styles. For example, each year since 2010-2017 IPA-American is the beer style with a new number of beers added in the year. Since 2018 The first place is taken by New England-IPA. Interestingly Lager isn’t in the top 10 list from 2010-2019 but it made the list in 2020 and 2021 by being on 8th and 9th this is interesting because lager isn’t considered as a beer. 7.2 Limitations We web-scraped the beer data from the Untappd website, unfortunately, we could only get our hands on the top 24 popular beers per brewery without using their official rest API. We tried to request it through the official channel, but their site states explicitly that the API would not be used for any type of research or personal projects, which is the reason we went for the web-scraping approach. Ideally, we would like to include the beers for this project. About half of beer entries have missing values in the beer characteristics columns (beer_ibu and beer_abv), we had to drop those beers for specific analyses, we thought about imputing those missing values by using the average values of similar beers brewed by the same brewery. Due to the time constraint, we didn’t pursue this idea further. 7.3 Future Work Since we’ve come this far and built out the data pipeline already, we really want to do all the analyses once again using the full beer data. To do that, we need to get the Untappd approval for using their official API or figure out a different strategy to web-scrape all the data (since each beer page is a publicly available page we just need to figure out a way to resolve those URLs). In addition, the Untappd API gives us access to the user level data, that would open up all kinds of possibilities for new research topics such understanding people’s rating behaviors. As beer hunters ourselves, we really want to find good beers. As we collect more beer data, we could potentially build a recommender system for ourselves to guide our beer hunting adventure. The good news is that Untappd actually allows us to download our own beer rating data if we pay a small patronage, we could easily plug in our beer history into to get new beer recommendations. If possible we would like to get data on beer ingredients (hops, malts and yeasts) and brewing techniques, we could run an analysis on what ingredients and compositions make a beer more desirable. We could even take this one step further by training a machine learning model to predict whether or not a beer would become highly rated given its ingredients, techniques, brewery and other information we could collect on this beer.
